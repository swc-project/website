## Common Profiling Steps

If you have a problem with SWC minifier about memory allocation and you are on mac, you can use [`ddt`][] to profile the memory usage.
Also, many steps are common to any kind of profiling.

#### Step 1. Prepare the inputs

If you want to check the example directory for inputs, you can take a look at https://github.com/kdy1/swc-minifier-inputs.

In this example, we will assume that the link above is cloned to `~/projects/minifier-inputs`.
(i.e. `git clone https://github.com/kdy1/swc-minifier-inputs.git ~/projects/minifier-inputs`)

Replace `~/projects/minifier-inputs` in the commands below with the directory containing your input files. It can be either a file or a directory containing the input files.
All .js files will be minified, without writing the result to the disk.

#### Step 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swc-project/swc.git
cd ./swc/crates/swc_ecma_minifier
```

## Profiling Time Usage

### Step 3. Run the profiler

You have two options. One is to use `samply`, which is cross-platform, and the other is to use XCode Instruments, which is only available on mac.

#### Using `samply`

```bash
CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=1 RUST_LOG=off ddt profile samply cargo --release --features concurrent --example minify-all -- ~/projects/minifier-inputs  to the directory containing your input files. It can be either a file or a directory containing the input files. All .js files will be minified (without writing the result to the disk)
```

This will open a tab in your browser once the profiling is done.

#### Using XCode Instruments

```bash
CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=1 RUST_LOG=off ddt profile instruments cargo -t time --release --features concurrent --example minify-all -- ~/projects/minifier-inputs  to the directory containing your input files. It can be either a file or a directory containing the input files. All .js files will be minified (without writing the result to the disk)
```

This will open the Instruments app once the profiling is done.

## Profiling Memory Usage

### Step 3. Run the profiler

The command to run the profiler is as follows:

```bash
CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=1 RUST_LOG=off ddt profile instruments cargo -t 'Memory' --release --features concurrent --example minify-all -- ~/projects/minifier-inputs  to the directory containing your input files. It can be either a file or a directory containing the input files. All .js files will be minified (without writing the result to the disk)
```

This will open the Instruments app once the profiling is done.
