## try catch([#483](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/483)

`swc` now handles catch parameter properly.

## Typescript enum ([#486](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/486))

Previously, code generated for typescript enums with initializers was wrong.
From now, valid code is generated.
