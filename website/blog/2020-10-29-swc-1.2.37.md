## Bugfixes

### ascii-only output ([#1191](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1191))

Previously [swc] emitted utf-8 output and had some bug related to escape, but[swc] now emits only ascii characters.

### error instead of panic ([#1170](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1170))

Previously [swc] panicked if the `parse` is called with the code below.

```
const toString: (local)(this: Function) => string) = undefined;
```

This behavior is wrong and [swc] now emits error instead of panicking.

### codegen bug of if ([#1185](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1185))

Previously [swc] emitted a wrong output for the code below.

```ts
if (...) {}
else foo++;
```

Thanks to [@braddunbar](https://github.com/braddunbar), it's now fixed and the generated code works as expected.

### typeof helper issue ([#1183](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1183))

`typeof` helper had a bug which occurs in a runtime without `Symbol`. It's fixed by [@wessberg](https://github.com/wessberg).

### invalid escapes in template literals ([#1175](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1175))

According to `es2018` specification, the code below is valid.

```js
latex`\unicode`;
```

But previously, [swc] could not parse it. This is now fixed by [@braddunbar](https://github.com/braddunbar).

### error recoveries ([#1189](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1189))

The parser of [swc] can now recover from strict-mode violations.

It means, even if your file has some errors, you can still get ast although it's not valid.
As one purpose of [swc] is being a basic building block, this is big win.

### dce bug ([#1157](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1157))

The dead code elimination pass had a bug related to class properties, and it's now fixed.

Now code like below works well after optimizing.

```ts
export interface D {
  resolve: any;
  reject: any;
}

export function d(): D {
  let methods;
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    methods = { resolve, reject };
  });
  return Object.assign(promise, methods);
}
```

### hygiene bug ([#1144](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1144))

[swc] had a bug which makes default value in object patterns miscompiled. This is now fixed.

## Bundler

Starting from [deno]@1.5, there's an option `--no-check` in options of `deno bundle`.
It uses `swc_bundler`, which is a general implementation of a web asset bundler.
While integrating, the [deno] team reported many bugs and those are all fixed.

### import and export from a module ([#1152](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1152))

Previously the bundler failed to process code below.

```ts
import { a as defaultA, O } from "./m.ts";
export { O } from "./m.ts";

interface AOptions {
  a?(): void;
  c?: O;
}

class A {
  #a: () => void;
  #c?: O;
  constructor(o: AOptions = {}) {
    const { a = defaultA, c } = o;
    this.#a = a;
    this.#c = c;
  }

  a() {
    this.#a();
  }

  c() {
    console.log(this.#c);
  }
}

let a = new A();
a.a();
a.c();
```

This is because there was no logic to handle exports and imports from a module. This is fixed by adding such logic.

### computed access to namespace imports ([#1159](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1159))

This made https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.3.1/examples/server.ts work after bundling.

### determinisctic output ([#1166](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1166))

For reliability, I made the output of `swc_bundler` deterministic.

### pass ordering ([#1171](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1171))

The pass ordering was wrong, and resulted in a bug, which prevents https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.3.1/examples/sseServer.ts from working after bundling.

### export \* ([#1154](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1154))

The bundler of [swc] had a bug related to `export *` where a function or a class is exported. This is fixed by applying same rule as variable exports.

## TypeScript 4.1

### as in mapped type ([#1151](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1151))

Thanks to [@g-plane](https://github.com/g-plane), the code below now works.

```ts
let map: { [P in string as string]: number };
```

### template literal type ([#1190](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1190))

Thanks to [@g-plane](https://github.com/g-plane), the code below now works.

```ts
type MultiLine = `
some value
`;
type WithTypes = `with-a-${string}`;
type WithTypes2 = `with-a-${MyAlias}-end`;
```
