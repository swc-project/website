## Documentations

`.d.ts` files and the documentation of [swc][] is now consistent.

See: [configuring swc](https://swc-project.github.io/docs/configuring-swc.html)

## Bugfixes

### spack ([#1075](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1075), [#1078](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1078))

- Panic while calculating the least common ancestor.

Previously, in some cases, lca calculation resulted in a panic because root entries do not have any ancestor.

- Cyclic imports mixed with normal imports

This was tricky to fix because `spack` works in the parallel manner. You can't know which module is loaded first, and even the order of processing is not determined.

- Cyclic imports in the root entry

Previously, [swc][] could not handle cyclic imports in the root entry. But it's now fixed.

## musl support

[swc][] finally supports musl. It was my long-cherished project, and finally fixed by [@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn).

## @swc/jest

It's a much faster alternative for ts-jest without type checking.
