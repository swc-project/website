## Bugfixes

### Source maps ([#705](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/705), [#707](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/707))

Starting from v1.1.34, `swc` handles the source map correctly.

### .d.ts support typescript parser

Previously, `swc` could not handle `.d.ts` files properly, as the syntax differs.
I've added a feature to parse optional binding patterns in the code below.

```ts
declare namespace __event {
  export class EventInit {
    constructor({
      bubbles,
      cancelable,
      composed
    }?: {
      bubbles?: boolean | undefined;
      cancelable?: boolean | undefined;
      composed?: boolean | undefined;
    });
  }
}
```
