## Bugfixes

### throw in nested finally block ([#601](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/601))

Previously,

```js
function* foo() {
  try {
  } finally {
    try {
    } finally {
      throw new Error("foo");
    }
  }
}
```

make `swc` panic. `swc` is now ok with it.

It was really hard to create a minimal reporduction case.

### use-use conflict in hygiene ([#599](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/599))

All of the `_templateObject` in below code refer to differect function.

```js
export function foo() {
  console.log(i18n(_templateObject()));
  console.log(i18n(_templateObject()));
  console.log(i18n(_templateObject()));
  console.log(i18n(_templateObject()));
}
```

But as previously swc cannot detect use-use conflict, it was miscompiled as-is.

### Optimizer bug ([#596](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/596))

Thanks to [@erikdesjardins](https://github.com/erikdesjardins), swc's optimizer does not break codes like

```js
if (0 | x) y = 1;
else y = 2;
```

```js
if (1 | x) y = 1;
else y = 2;
```

```js
if (0 & x) y = 1;
else y = 2;
```

```js
if (1 & x) y = 1;
else y = 2;
```

## Span improvements

Thanks to [@dsherret](https://github.com/dsherret), there are more span improvements.

- as and const assertions ([#593](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/593))
- semicolon of a dynamic import statement ([#595](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/595))
