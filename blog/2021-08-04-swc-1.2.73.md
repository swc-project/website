## Improvements

### `import.meta` in scripts

Now swc reports an error if `import.meta` is used in scripts.

Implemented by [@sosukesuzuki](https://github.com/sosukesuzuki) and by [#1999](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1999).

## Bugfixes

### codegen of regex (minified) ([#2000](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2000))

Previously swc omitted a semicolon in some cases.

Fixed by [#2004](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2004).

### Order of import statements

Previously the minifier changed order of import statements.

Fixed by [#2005](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2005).

### jsx: `@jsxImportSource` in `classic` mode ([#1933](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1933))

Previously swc ignored `@jsxImportSource` if runtime is `classic`, but this is wrong.

Fixed by [#2004](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2004).
