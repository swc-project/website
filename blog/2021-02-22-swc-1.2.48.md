## Bugfixes

### Parsing of generics ([#1405](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1405))

The parser of [swc][] failed to parse below code if `tsx` is enabled.

```ts
function foo<P extends RouteParams = RP, S extends State = RS>(
  name: string,
  path: string,
  ...middleware: RouterMiddleware<P, S>[]
): Router<P extends RP ? P : P & RP, S extends RS ? S : S & RS>;
{
}
```

This is reported by a deno team member via discord and now it's fixed.

### `await (await foo)()` ([#1395](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1395))

[swc][] now doesn't break code like below.

```ts
await(await foo)();
```

### Catch parameters ([#1413](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1413))

[swc][] previously miscompiled code like below.

```ts
var e = 1;
try {
  throw 2;
} catch {
  console.log(e);
}
```

This was the case because the `hygiene` passs didn't do caclulated renaming operations while handling a catch clause.
It's now fixed.

## Bundler bugfixes

### Correct handling of export defaults ([#1373](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1373))

Previously the bundler miscompiled some export-`default`-ed functions if it depends on hoisting.

Affected code looks like

```ts
import log from "./log.js";

cli();

export default async function cli() {
  log("It works!");
}
```

but it's now fixed.

## Performacne improvements

### Parser performance improvement ([#1411](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1411))

This pr was intended to reduce wasted memry space and it resulted in 10% performance boost of the parser.

## New features

## New jsx transforms ([#1408](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1408))

Config api is almost identical with the one of babel.

### preset-env with custom config path ([#1374](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1374))

Thanks to [@mcnicholls](https://github.com/mcnicholls), [swc][] now supports using `.browserlistrc` or `package.json` in any path for determining environment.

See [docs](https://swc.rs/docs/preset-env#path) for more details.

## Misc

### Reduction of binary size ([#1418](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1418))

Thanks to [@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn), the binary size of [swc][] is reduced.
