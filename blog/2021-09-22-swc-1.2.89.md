## Improvements

### `wasm`: `paths`, `baseUrl`, `hygiene`

Now `@swc/wasm` supports `jsc.paths` and `jsc.baseUrl`. Additionally, it now renames variables correctly.

Implemented by [#2279](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2279).

## Bugfixes

### `hygiene` ([#2211](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2211))

Previously the `hygiene` pass didn't consider child scope correctly.

Fixed by [#2266](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2266).

### `codegen`: Sourcemap of string literals ([#2253](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2253))

SourceMaps were off by one.

Fixed by [#2256](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2256).

### `codegen`: `static` before `readonly`

Previously the code emitted `readonly` before `static`.

Fixed by [@dsherret](https://github.com/dsherret) and by [#2271](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2271)

### `minifier`: Variable merging ([#2262](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2262))

Previously the minifier wrongly dropped some variables.

Fixed by [@dsherret](https://github.com/dsherret) and by [#2271](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2271)

### `opt-chain`: ES2019

Previously `swc` treated it as a pass for `ES2018`, but now it's treated as a pass for `ES2019`.

Fixed by [#2247](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2247).
