## Improvements

### Support for cpus without aes-ni ([#1807](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1807))

swc used `aes-ni` instructions via compiler optimization to make swc faster, but it turns out that some user uses cpu without `aes-ni`.
So I turned optimization off.

This will make swc slower, but it's still fast.

Fixed by [#2109](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2109)
