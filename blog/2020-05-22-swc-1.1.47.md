## Bugfixes

### typescript imports ([#791](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/791))

`swc` had a bug related to type-only imports. Problematic codes include

```ts
import { IPerson } from "../types/types";
export interface IEmployee extends IPerson {}
export function createPerson(person: IPerson) {
  const a = {} as IPerson;
}
```

```ts
import { IPerson } from "../types/types";
export class Employee implements IPerson {}
export function createPerson(person: IPerson) {
  const a = {} as IPerson;
}
```

```ts
import { IPerson } from "../types/types";
export type MyPerson = IPerson;
export function createPerson(person: MyPerson) {
  const a = {} as MyPerson;
}
```

```ts
import { A, B } from "../types/types";

export class Child extends A implements B {}
```

These code works correctly with swc@v1.1.47
