## Bugfixes

### parser: Long numeric literals ([#1803](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1803), [#1806](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1806))

swc now can handle very long numeric literals like

```ts
00000020000000000000000000000000;
```

or

```ts
0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002225073858507201;
```

### logical assignments ([#1788](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1788))

swc now transpiles

```ts
a ||= b;
```

and

```ts
a ??= b;
```

properly.

### escapes in jsx properties ([#1782](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1782))

There was a bug which make using unicode chracters in jsx properties hard.

### preset-env: Nullish assignments ([#1812](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1812))

Because some browsers support nullish coaelscing operator while not supporting nullish assignments, I patched swc to transpile assignments to assignment with nullish coaelscing operator.

### Line terminators in literals ([#1754](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1754))

EcmaScript allows some strange chracters to be used in a string literal.
Previously swc didn't allow it, but it's now fixed by [@tmpfs](https://github.com/tmpfs).

### optimizer: Side effects of while ([#1825](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1825))

Previsously the dead branch remover of swc was to aggressive and could break codes like

```ts
while ((p(), 1)) {}
while ((await something.foo, 1)) {}
```

This is now fixed.

### parser: Undefined unicode codepoints ([#1813](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1813))

For rust-side users of swc, the code below made program error with arithmetic overlfow.

```ts
\u{cccccccccsccccccQcXt[uc(~).const[uctor().const[uctor())tbr())
```

## Platform support

### old linux ([#1809](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1809))

swc now uses older version of glibc to support old linux environments.
