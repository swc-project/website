## Bugfixes

### TypeScript enum with key / value ([#730](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/730))

Thanks to [@gus3inov](https://github.com/gus3inov), swc now handles typescript enum correctly.

```ts
enum StateNum {
  closed = "cl0",
  opened = "op1",
  mounted = "mo2"
}
```

### await after yield ([#720](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/720))

The code like below is parsed correctly.

```ts
async function* main() {
  yield await 0;
}
```
