## Improvements

### codegen when minify = true ([#1986](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1986))

The code generator got lots of patches and now it emits optimal output for mant test cases.
(It's tested with test262 test suite)

Fixed by [#1990](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1990).

### Minifier improvements

This version includes some more rules for compressing AST nodes.

## Bugfixes

### Using minification with transform ([#1989](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1989))

Previous version did not support using the minifier with `transform*` apis.
This is a bug and it's now fixed by [#1990](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1990).
