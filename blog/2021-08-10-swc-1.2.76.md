## Improvements

### minifier

More rules are implemented and it will emit more compact code than before.

Related: [#2039](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2039).

### bundler: `browser` in package.json ([#1956](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1956))

The bundler now supports `browser` field of package.json.

Implemented by [@tmpfs](https://github.com/tmpfs) and by [#2045](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2045)

## Bugfixes

### Block scoping ([#2027](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2027))

Previously swc could break code like

```ts
const keys = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
};

const controller = {};

for (const key in keys) {
  controller[key] = (c, ...d) => {
    console.log(keys[key]);
  };
}
```

which defines a rest argument in an arrow expression in a for loop.

Fixed by [#2034](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2034).

### Mixed import specifiers ([#1734](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1734))

Previously swc had a bug which can break your code if you import from a module using both of default specifier and named spaecifier, but with different import statemetns.

Fixed by [#2034](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2034).

### Constructor arguments ([#2021](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2021))

This bug is caused by code written 3 years ago, and could break some class codes if constructor uses declared class properties.

Fixed by [#2034](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2034).

### regenerator: `||` ([#2024](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2024))

Now `(await sleep()) || 'fallback'` works properly.

Fixed by [#2034](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2034).

### `jsc.paths` ([#1934](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1934), [#1935](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1935))

Previously it was not usable with typescript, but it's finally fixed and it will work as expected.

Fixed by [#2043](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2043).
