## Bugfixes

### Type definition of FunctionDeclaration ([#1602](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1602))

Fixed by [@wavesheep](https://github.com/wavesheep)

### optimizer: Fix for do-while loops ([#1518](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1618))

Previously the optimizer of [swc][] errornously removed some loops.

Fixed by [@wbinnssmith](https://github.com/wbinnssmith).

### Codegen of null character ([#1619](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1619))

[swc][] now emits `\x00` instead of `\00` for null charcters.

### preset-env: Import order of core-js modules ([#1605](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1605))

Now [swc][] uses indexed sets for managing imports.

### `&nbsp;` in jsx entities ([#1446](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1446))

Previously swc blindly treated `&nbsp;` in jsx entities as a whitespace (because it is) and it resulted in `&nbsp;` being removed. This is now fixed and it works as expected.

### Type definition of options ([#1621](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1621))

Fixed by [@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn).

### HasDecorators.decorators: optional ([#1603](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1603))

Now `Parameter` allows `decorators` property to be skipped.

### Super in sequence expressions ([#1617](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1617))

Previously swc miscompiled code like

```ts
class A extends B {
  foo() {
    super.foo(), bar();
  }
}
```

### TypeScript dynamic imports ([#1614](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1614))

There was a bug which occurs if the dynamic import is only import of a module.

Affected code looks like

```ts
(async () => {
  const example = await import("./example");
  console.log(example.foo);
})();
```

### TypeScript common js exports ([#1593](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1593))

[swc][] now supports

```ts
export Foo = 'example';
```

### optimizer: Preserve x instanceof Object ([#1630](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1630))

Previously [swc][] mis-optimized

```ts
let x = undefined;
if (x instanceof Object) {
  console.log(x.obj);
}
```

Fixed by [@mischnic](https://github.com/mischnic).

### react: Pass ordering ([#1639](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1639))

Fixed by [@mischnic](https://github.com/mischnic).

### resolver: Fix setter properties ([#](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1647))

Preivously the scope analyzer of [swc][] had a bug related to setter property.
But this bug is not expected to affect any real world code because it only affects setter properties.

### Type definition of JSXOpeningElement ([#1608](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1608))

Fixed by [@vemoo](https://github.com/vemoo).

### Method with keyword names ([#1651](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1651))

This bug would affect code which uses a keyword as a method name.

## Performance improvements

### bundler: Skip works ([#1599](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1599))

Previously [swc][] did analysis for all modules, even if it does not have any imports.
It's not necessary and it's now removed.

### bundler: Rework ([#1601](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1601))

[swc][] had a faulty design, which made the bundler slow.
These legacy codes are removed, and [swc][] becomes much faster.

### bundler: Detection of circular imports ([#1610](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1610))

With the release, [swc][] does not perform graph operations.
It makes bundling modules with lots of ciruclar graph much faster.
