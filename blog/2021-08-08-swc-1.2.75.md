### minifier: Infinite loop ([#2028](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2028))

Previous version of minifier throwed an error for

```js
function isSymbol(s) {
  return s != null;
}

function isKey(value, object) {
  if (value == null || isSymbol(value)) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

module.exports = isKey;
```

Fixed by [#2032](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2032).

Previsouly minifier was enabled even you pass `minify: false`.

### codegen: `return async ()` ([#2020](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2020))

Previously minified codegen didn't emit a space between `return` and `async`.

Fixed by [#2032](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2032).
