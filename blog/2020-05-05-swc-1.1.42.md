## Bugfixes

### Dead code elimination ([#763](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/763))

Previously, dead code elimination pass of `swc` dropped some used imports. It was cause by iteration order.

In the code below,

```js
import { A, B } from "library";
const arr = [A, B];

console.log(B);
arr.map((v) => console.log(v));
```

after `console.log(B)` and `arr.map(...)` are evaluated, the import statement is visited and incorrectly dropped `A`.

This is fixed by extracting import handling as a new phase. The new version of `swc` does not drop imports while every other things are evaluated.
