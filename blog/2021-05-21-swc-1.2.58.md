## Bugfixes

### codegen: `\r\n` in template literals. ([#1707](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1707))

This happens only if your target is `es2016` or upper.
This issue is reported via [a deno issue](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/10282), and

```js
const content1 = `first line\r\nsecond line\r\nthird line`;

const content2 = `first line
second line
third line`;

console.log({ content1, content2 });
```

now works properly.

### fixer: `null ?? (undefined && true)`. ([#1709](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1709))

This issue is reported via [a deno issue](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/10668).
This is fixed by explicitly handling `a ?? (b && c)`.

### optimizer: Preserve optional chaining expressions. ([#1688](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1688))

```ts
({ notafunction: null }?.notafunction?.());
```

```ts
({ notafunction: null }?.notafunction());
```

```ts
({ notafunction: null }.notafunction?.());
```

swc preivously didn't handle optional chaining expresison propely and had break the codes above.
It's now fixed.

### optimizer: Side-effects of `[x, y][0]`. ([#1674](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1674))

Previously the optimizer of swc had a bug which breaks code like

```ts
let foo = "info";

var bar = [foo, (foo = "other")][0];

console.log(foo == "other");
console.log(bar == "info");
```

It's now fixed.

### parser: Non-identifier names in getters. ([#1671](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1671))

```ts
const thing = {
  get "a-b"() {
    return "abc";
  },
};
console.log(thing["a-b"]);
```

Due to a bug, swc previously faild to parse the code above.
It's now fixed.

### parser: Class member named `declare` ([#1671](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1671))

```ts
class A {
  private declare() {}
}
```

The code above now works properly.

### compat: async-to-generator ([#1721](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1721), [#1722](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1722))

swc now compiles

```ts
async function* lol() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
}

async function main() {
  for await (const x of lol()) {
    console.log(x);
  }
}
main();
```

and

```ts
(async function main() {
  console.log(1);
})();
```

correctly.

### react: Remove panic call ([#1683](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1683))

```ts
const config = {
  test: /\.[jt]sx?$/i,
  exclude: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
  use: [
    {
      loader: "swc-loader",
      options: {
        jsc: {
          target: "es5",
          parser: {
            tsx: true,
            decorators: true,
            syntax: "typescript",
            dynamicImport: true,
          },
          transform: {
            react: {
              runtime: "automatic",
            },
          },
          externalHelpers: true,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

swc had a bug in new jsx pass which resulted in an exception thrown.
It's now fixed.

### parser: Type-only import equals ([#1695](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1695))

```ts
import type React = require("react");
```

This is valid syntax since typescript 4.2, but swc didn't support it.

Fixed by [@g-plance](https://github.com/g-plane).

### compat: Private methods ([#1694](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1694), [#1702](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1702), [#1711](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1711))

Previously swc had a bug related to private class methods.

### preset-env: Update compat data ([#1704](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1704), [#1719](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1719))

The compatibility data was outdated.

### typescript: Preserved `module` context ([#1698](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1698), [#1706](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1706))

`tsc` emits

```js
export {};
```

for

```ts
export type Foo = number;
```

while other tools do not preserve the information that the file is module.

Because `swc` prefers the bahavior of `tsc` over the one of `babel`, swc now emits `export {}` for type-only modules.

### wasm-web: Support for bundlers ([#1675](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1675))

The `@swc/wasm-web` package now use correct command while publishing so it has correct data in `package.json`.

### api: Types for react pass. ([#1720](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1720))

Fixed by [@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn).
