## Bugfixes

## New features

### Decorators on parameters ([#775](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/775))

The following is valid TypeScript code:

```ts
class MyClass {
  myMethod(@myDecorator myParameter: string) {}
}
```

Previously, `swc` cannot parse this as `swc` did not support decorators on a parameter. Thanks to [@dsherret](https://github.com/dsherret), the parser gets abillity to handle it.

### No-substitution template literals as type ([#767](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/767))

The code below is valid, and `swc` now supports the syntax. Implemented by [@dsherret](https://github.com/dsherret).

```ts
export type Permission = `CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE`;
```

## Performance improvements

### Parser ([#774](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/774))

Riccardo Dambrosio sent me an email which contains how can I improve the performance of parser. Based on the fact that 99% of input is ascii, he suggested short-circuiting ascii letters in the lexer.

I've tested it and it makes the parser of `swc` 10% ~ 13% faster.
