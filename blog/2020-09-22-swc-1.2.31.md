## Domain change

The swc project now uses [swc.rs](https://swc.rs), instead of [swc-project.github.io](https://swc.rs).
Thank you contributors!

## Bugfixes

### (spack) export \* in entry ([1083](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1083))

Previously, `export * from './a'` only worked in non-entry files.
It's a common pattern to export everything from main module, so I think it's an important improvement.

### let with for in/of ([#1086](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1086))

Previously, [swc][] miscompiled the code shown below.

```js
const b = [];
{
  let a;
  for (a in b) {
    console.log(a);
  }
}
```

The bug is realted to left hand side in the for-in loop.

### File names in the source map is preserved ([#1091](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1091))

This is about feeding source code into [swc][] after processing using other tools with source map support.

[@lujjjh](https://github.com/lujjjh) kindly found the cause and proposed solution.

### (spack) Fixed imports ([#1076](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1076))

The `spack` had a bug related to packages without `main` field in `package.json`.

### optional chaining ([#1092](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1092))

Starting with the version, [swc][] can compile

```js
a?.b.c();
```

into the correct output, namely

```js
a === null || a === void 0 ? void 0 : a.b.c();
```

### logical operators and function calls ([#1093](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1093))

Previously, [swc][] erroneously removed the parenthesis which wraps `fnA || fnB`. This is now fixed.

```js
const fnA = () => {
  console.log("Output from function A");
};

const fnB = () => {
  console.log("Output from function B");
};

const x = (fnA || fnB)();
```

### regenerator scoping issue ([#1036](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1036))

I had a hard time debugging this, because all pass work correctly. It was pass ordering issue, and I fixed pass ordering. The bug affects user who used an array pattern (`[a,,c]`) or an object pattern (`{ a: foo }`) within async function.

Example of the affected code is show below.

```js
const x = async function () {
  console.log(
    await Promise.all(
      [[1], [2], [3]].map(async ([a]) => Promise.resolve().then(() => a * 2))
    )
  );
};
```

```

```
