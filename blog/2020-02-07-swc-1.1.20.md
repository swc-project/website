## Improvements

### Smaller runtime dependency ([#631](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/631))

`swc` now imports `regenerator-runtime` instead of `@babel/runtime/regenerator`. This is not a breaking change because `@babel/runtime` depends on `regenerator-runtime`.

From now on, you can remove `@babel/runtime` from dependencies.

### Better error message ([#650](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/650))

Instead of showing `require failed`, `swc` emits proper error message (`swc: You have to install browserslist to use env`) to stderr.

### TypeScript privatge fields ([#642](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/642))

TypeScript 3.8 added the concept of private fields. As `swc` had private field support for ecmascript, adding support for typescript was easy.

```ts
class Person {
    #name: string

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.#name = name;
    }

    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.#name}!`);
    }
}

let jeremy = new Person("Jeremy Bearimy");

jeremy.#name
//     ~~~~~
// Property '#name' is not accessible outside class 'Person'
// because it has a private identifier.

```

### TypeScript: export namespace from ([#647](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/647))

TypeScript 3.8 allows code like

```ts
export * as utilities from "./utilities.js";
```

As it's official typescript syntax, `export * as namespace from 'foo'` does not require changing any config.

## Bugfixes

## Escpaes in template literals ([#652](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/652))

Previously, codes like

```js
`\x1b[33m Yellow \x1b[0m`;
```

were broken by `swc`. `swc` handles escapes in template literals correctly.

### TypeScript imports ([#641](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/641))

`swc` strips out type-only imports correctly.
