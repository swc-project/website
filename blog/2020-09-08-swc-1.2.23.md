## New features

### jsx pragma ([#1015](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1015))

[swc][] finally suports jsx pragma, which is required to use some libraries like [emotion.sh](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

```js
// this comment tells babel to convert jsx to calls to a function called jsx instead of React.createElement
/** @jsx jsx */
import { css, jsx } from "@emotion/core";

const color = "white";

render(
  <div
    css={css`
      padding: 32px;
      background-color: hotpink;
      font-size: 24px;
      border-radius: 4px;
      &:hover {
        color: ${color};
      }
    `}
  >
    Hover to change color.
  </div>
);
```

### BingInt literal type ([#1020](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1020))

I didn't know that it is valid syntax, but the code below is validl, and [swc][] now supports it.

```ts
const a: 1000n = 1000n;
```

### Dynamic imports in non-es6 modules ([#1028](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1028))

Dynamic imports are not widely supported, so it should be transcompiled.

```js
describe("foo", () => {
  it("should import", async () => {
    expect.assertions(1);

    const { FOO } = await import("./foo");

    expect(FOO).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

is now compiled as

```js
describe("foo", () => {
  it("should import", async () => {
    expect.assertions(1);

    const { FOO } = await Promise.resolve().then(function () {
      return require("./foo");
    });

    expect(FOO).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

if the module config is common js.

### Block scoping ([#1029](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1029))

`this` is now correctly handled in the loops.

```js
class C {
  m() {
    for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) console.log(this, (y) => y != x);
  }
}
```

Also, you can now mutate the index variable while iterating.

e.g.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(
    i++,
    [2].every((x) => x != i)
  );
}
```

### fixer: binary expression in callee of new ([#1030](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1030))

Previously [swc][] miscompiled

```ts
return new (P || (P = Promise))(function (resolve, reject) {
  // ....
});
```

into

```js
return (
  new P() ||
  (P = Promise)(function (resolve, reject) {
    // ....
  })
);
```

which is wrong. Now it's fixed and [swc][] emits correct output.

### Support for large binary expressions ([#1032](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1032))

I fixed the code generator, parser, typescript stripper, fixer pass, resolver pass and hygiene pass to handle very large binary expressions.

As a result, [swc][] can now compile very large binary expressions like those in [seedlings](https://github.com/use-seedling/seedling/blob/3c92c53b9fa2038a934d7cc5f646e726215147ef/src/css/prose.ts)

### Correct this in optional chaining ([#1035](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1035))

Previously, [swc][] miscompiled

```js
a.focus?.();
```

into

```js
"use strict";
var ref;
(ref = a.focus) === null || ref === void 0 ? void 0 : ref.call(ref);
```

which is wrong. It should be

```js
"use strict";
var ref;
(ref = a.focus) === null || ref === void 0 ? void 0 : ref.call(a);
```

and [swc][] now emits correct code.

## spack ([#1016](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1016), [#1031](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1031), [#1034](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1034))

I did very hard work on it, and many edge cases are fixed. I don't think it's production ready yet, but it will be in a near future.

As a side note, [#1016](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1016) is about ecmascript imports and [#1031](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1031) and [#0134](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1034) are about complex reexports and common js support, respectively.

## Performance improvement

[swc][] becomes faster and it will be much faster with the next version. Its performance is similar to it of [esbuild][], even though there are so many low-hanging fruits.
