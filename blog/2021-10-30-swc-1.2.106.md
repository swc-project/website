## Improvements

### Performance

`swc` now parse input in worker thread, instead of blocking js thread.

Fixed by [#2590](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2590).

## Bugfixes

### multiple jsx pragma in single comment ([#2560]{https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2560})

`swc` now understands `/* @jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource preact */`

Fixed by [@hlubek](https://github.com/hlubek) and by [#2561](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2561)

### Parsing of interpreters

Previously the parser of `swc` parsed interpreters wrongly.

Fixed by [@antoniomuso](https://github.com/antoniomuso) and by [#2589](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2589).

### inlined sourcemap

`swc` now uses correct base64 encoding for inlined source maps.

Fixed by [@Kaciras](https://github.com/Kaciras) and by [#2585](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2585)

### minifier: block

Previously the minifier removed some necessary block and it resulted in an error.

Fixed by [#2570](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2570)

### dead_branch_remover: `this` ([#2465](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2465), [#2466](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2466))

Previously `dead_branch_remover` didn't preserved `this` in some cases.

Fixed by [#2466](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2466)

### minifier: module mode ([#2254](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2254))

The minifier will now enable optimization of top level nodes if `module: true` is provided.

Fixed by [#2564](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2564).

### minifier: depth of function ([#2558](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2558))

Previously the minifier didn't consider 'depth' of a function declaration while negating if statements and it could break some libraries.

Fixed by [#2564](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2564).

### assignment to exported function ([#2549](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2549))

Previously `swc` didn't allow reassignment to exported functions. This was problematic for `jest` users.

Fixed by [@kwonoj](https://github.com/kwonoj) and by [#2569](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2569).
