## Span regressions

`swc@v.1.1.34` made many changes to the parser, and it also introduced some regressions of span.

### Start of arrow in conditional expression ([#712](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/712))

The span of the code like

```js
referrer ? false : ([, specifier]): string => specifier;
```

is now fixed.

### Decorators on class ([#711](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/711))

Example code:

```js

@decorator<string>()
class Test {}
```

### Tagged template literals ([#714](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/714))

Example code:

```ts
f<T>``;
```

## Bugfixes

### Ambient context ([#715](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/715))

Example code:

```ts
declare namespace __event {
  export class EventInit {
    constructor({
      bubbles,
      cancelable,
      composed
    }?: {
      bubbles?: boolean | undefined;
      cancelable?: boolean | undefined;
      composed?: boolean | undefined;
    });
  }
}
```

### async in start of conditional expression ([#717](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/717))

Previously, `swc` had a bug which make `swc` reject codes like the below.

```ts
function functionFlags(async: boolean) {
  return async ? 1 : 0;
}
```

This is fixed, and `async` can be the start of a conditional expression.

## New features

### "inline" source maps

Previously, `swc/cli` handled this, and providing `'inline'` to `swc/core` had no effect.
From now, `swc/core` handles it so code like

```js
let output = swc.transformSync("let x = 3;", {
  sourceMaps: "inline",

  jsc: {
    parser: {
      syntax: "ecmascript"
    },
    transform: {}
  }
});

console.log(output.code);
```

works as expected.
