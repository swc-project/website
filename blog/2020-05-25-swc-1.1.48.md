## Bugfixes

### typescript casts ([#794](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/794))

Previously, `swc` dropped the type information in casts without visiting it. It caused

```ts
import { IPerson } from "../types/types";
export function createPerson(person) {
  const a = {} as IPerson;
}
```

to be compiled as

```ts
// The import is not dropped.
import { IPerson } from "../types/types";
export function createPerson(person) {
  const a = {};
}
```

This is fixed by visiting types, and `swc` now emits

```js
export function createPerson(person) {
  const a = {};
}
```

### Plugin ([#785](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/785))

Plugin was broken because `swc.transformSync` emits original code even though user modified the ast. This is fixed and to prevent such regession, I moved node-swc into the main repository.
