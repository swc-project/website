## Bugfixes

### bundler: Handle of `export *` correctly. ([#1264](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1264))

Previously the bundler of [swc][] did not exclude `default` while handling `export *`.
This is wrong and it's fixed.
As a result, you can now export default while using `export * from './foo'`

```ts
export { default } from "./foo";
export * from "./foo";
```

The code above now works.

### bundler: Fix statement ordering. ([#1264](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1264))

Order of statements are now preserved.
Previously, the bundler only considers about dependancy, but it resulted in some bugs so I patched it to preserve original order.

### bundler: Group statements from same module. ([#1264](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1264))

While flattening all statements, the bundler now prefers statements from same module.
It will help debugging the bundle, as related statements live at simillar place.

### fixer: Handle assignmnet in new exprssion correctly. ([#1264](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1264))

Previously [swc][] errornously removed parenthesis from `const a = new (a = b);`.
It resulted in `const a = new a = b;`, which has different meaning.

### fixer: Handle comma expression in new exprssion correctly. ([#1264](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1264))

Previously [swc][] errornously removed parenthesis from `const a = new (a, b);`.
It resulted in `const a = new a, b;` , which has different meaning.
This is now fixed.

### bundler: Prevent duplicate variable. ([#1296](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1296))

This bug occurrs when `export * as foo` is mixed with `export * from ''` more than three times, and with `import`.
It's now fixed and bundler bundles it correctly.

### bundler: Handle keywords. ([#1296](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1296))

EcmaScript allows using keywords as an identifier in some places.
As the bundler flatten statements, it made a variable named `instanceof` when it met `export { foo as instanceof }`.

But this is a bug and it's now renamed to something other.

### dce: Prevent tags in tagged template literals. ([#1296](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1296))

The dce was too aggresive and it removed tagged template literals.
It now preserves as tagged template literals can have side effect.

Note:

> If you are using some old target, you are not affected.

### dce: Handle throw statement correctly. ([#1296](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1296))

Again, it errornously removed something used by throw statement.
I patched it to mark argument as used correctly.
