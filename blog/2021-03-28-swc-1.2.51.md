## Bugfixes

### Column position in source maps ([#1470](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1470))

Thanks to [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett), [swc][] now emits correct source map regarding column offsets.

### `keepClassName` ([#1453](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1453))

The option `keepClasName` was introduced in [swc][] v1.2.50. But there was a bug at configuration merging, and it didn't work.
It's now fixed.

### Codegen of arrow functions ([#1452](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1452))

Arrow functions without parenthesis in arguments like `async foo => 0;` is now handled properly.

### bundler: Stack overflow on windows ([#1464](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1464))

This was reported via [deno][], by [#9752](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/9752).
Previously bunlding already-bundled file might cause stack overflow on windows, but it's now fixed.

### Assignments in await argument ([#1475](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1475))

Previsouly, [swc][] break the code like `await (bar = Promise.resolve(2));` by removing parens.
This is now fixed and it works properly.

### Parens in nullish coalescing ([#1496](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1496))

Previously [swc][] miscompiled

```ts
console.log(("a" ?? "b") || "");
```

into

```ts
console.log("a" ?? ("b" || ""));
```

which is wrong. [swc][] now emits

```ts
console.log(("a" ?? "b") || "");
```

### Jsx entities in jsx attribute values ([#1501](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1501))

[swc][] now compiles

```ts
<div id="abc&gt;" />
```

as

```ts
React.createElement("div", {
  id: "abc>",
});
```

regardless of target version.
