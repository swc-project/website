## Bugfixes

This version is published to fix serious problems of minifier.

### Exception on zero-arg call in ternary ([#1984](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1984))

Argument count is now properly checked.

### Exception on wasm ([#1982](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1982))

Previously swc printed logs related to timings. But `wasm` does not support time api, so calls to it panics.

Fixed by [#1985](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1985).

### name mangler ([#1983](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1983))
