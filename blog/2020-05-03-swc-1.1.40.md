## Bugfixes

### @swc/register ([#754](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/754))

Previously, `@swc/register` emitted error on normal files. This is fixed in `@swc/register@0.1.7`.

### typescript enum ([#757](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/757))

You can now `export default` typescript enums.

### requires with es6 imports ([#724](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/724))

Previously swc miscompiled code like

```js
import { A } from "a";
const B = require("B");
```

This is now fixed, and it works without any problem.
