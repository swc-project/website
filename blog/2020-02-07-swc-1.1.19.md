## New features

### Optional chaining in es ([#619](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/619))

Code like

```js
a?.b?.c;
```

is now possible within ecmascript.

As it's stage 3, you need to set an option to use it. See [the doc](https://swc-project.github.io/docs/configuring-swc.html#jscparser) for the option.

### top-level await ([#627](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/627))

`swc` can parse codes like

```js
await foo();
```

As it's stage 3, you need to set an option to use it. See [the doc](https://swc-project.github.io/docs/configuring-swc.html#jscparser) for the option. Also, note that you need to target es2017 or higher to use this feature.
