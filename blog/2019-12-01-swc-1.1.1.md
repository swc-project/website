## TypeScript enum

There was a bug related to typescript enum. I guess many compilation errors came from this.

From now, typescript enums work exactly same as enums compiled with babel.

## jsonify ([#409](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/409))

This optimization technique make loading script faster. This is port of [babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse](https://github.com/nd-02110114/babel-plugin-object-to-json-parse).

See [documentation](/docs/configuring-swc#jsctransformoptimizerjsonify).
