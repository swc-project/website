## Bugfixes

### export \* as ns ([#1142](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1142))

[swc][] now handle `export * as ns from 'foo';` by default, if you are targeting < `es2020`.

Also, spack and swc_bundler now supports it directly.

### conditional expression in await ([#1133](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1133))

[swc][] errornously removed parenthesis of conditional expression in await expressions.

### scope of optional chaining ([#1136](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1136))

Previously, [swc][] miscompiled the code below.

```ts
const PATCHES = new Map();

const ident = "foo";
const patch = PATCHES.get(ident)?.();
```

This was compiled as

```js
var _obj = PATCHES.get(ident),
  ref;
const PATCHES = new Map();
const ident = "foo";
const patch = (ref = _obj) === null || ref === void 0 ? void 0 : ref.call(_obj);
```

Which results in a runtime error.
This is caused by sharing variable buffer.
It's fixed by using two variable buffers.

### computed keys in object literal ([#1140](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1140))

The hygiene pass of [swc][] had a bug. The bug was that it does not visit `key` in `{ [key]: value }`.

This is fixed, and code like below works properly.

```ts
const categories = [{ key: "apple" }, { key: "banana" }, { key: "strawberry" }];

const item = "some item";

const catNames = categories.reduce((a, item) => {
  return { ...a, [item.key.toString()]: item };
}, {});
```

### bundler: deglob imports correctly ([#1139](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1139))

```ts
import * as circular2 from "./circular2.ts";

export function f1(): void {
  console.log("f1");
}

circular2.f2();
```

Previously, the code above was bundled as

```js
export function f1() {
  console.log("f1");
}
circular2.f2();
circular1.f1();
```

which is clearly wrong. It's now fixed.

### bundler: aliased imports ([#1138](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1138))

This bug occurs if nested export is mixed with aliased import.

`a.ts`:

```ts
export const a = "a";
```

`l.ts`:

```ts
export { a } from "./a.ts";
```

`entry.ts`:

```ts
import { a as defaultA } from "./l.ts";

const o: { a?: string } = {};

const { a = defaultA } = o;

console.log(a);
```

This resulted in

```js
const o = {};
const { a = defaultA } = o;
console.log(a);
```

which is wrong. It's now fixed and swc_bundler now supports quite complex imports.
