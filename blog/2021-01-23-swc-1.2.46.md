## Bugfixes

### Enums in namespaces ([#1340](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1340))

[swc][] had support for namespaces since `v1.2.46`. But the support was not complete and enums were not handled properly.
`v1.2.46` adds support for enums, so the code below works as expected.

```ts
namespace Test {
  export enum DummyValues {
    A = "A",
    B = "B",
  }
}

console.log(Test.DummyValues.A);
```

### Private class properties ([#1353](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1353))

Previously, [swc][] didn't compile _some_ of accesses to private properties of classes.
This is fixed as of `v1.2.46`, by visiting all children in the ast visitor.

### Block scoping ([#1353](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1353))

Preivously, [swc][] miscompiled some of loops including

```js
function combineOverlappingMatches(matches) {
  let hasOverlaps = false;

  for (let i = matches.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    let currentMatch = matches[i];
    let overlap = matches.find((match) => {
      return (
        match !== currentMatch && match.itemsType === currentMatch.itemsType
      );
    });

    if (overlap) {
      hasOverlaps = true;
      matches.splice(i, 1);
    }
  }

  if (hasOverlaps) {
    combineOverlappingMatches(matches);
  }
}

combineOverlappingMatches([1]);
```

This is now fixed by making block statement transparent in point of view of the block scoping visitor.
As this fix applies to all block statements, [swc][] would not break such loops.

### This in complex async arrow ([#1353](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1353))

Previously, [swc][] errornously changed `this` in the asynchronous arrow function below.

```ts
class A {
  val = "1";
  async foo() {
    try {
      return await (async (x) => x + this.val)("a"); // this is undefined
      // return await Promise.all(['a', 'b'].map(async (x) => x + this.val)); // this is undefined
    } catch (e) {
      throw e;
    }
  }
}

new A().foo();
```

This is fixed as of `v1.2.46`. Now [swc][] uses quite general logic for handling such code, and I expect it not to break asynchronous arrows anymore.

### bundler: Reserved word as an ident ([#1346](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1346))

As the bundler of [swc][] is falttening bundler just like rollup, it had some code to handle difference of identifier context.
For example, `instanceof` in the code below is valid,

```js
import * as foo from "./util";
const x = foo.instanceof;
```

while `instanceof` in the code below is invalid.

```js
const instanceof = function () {
  // ...
};
```

The bundler renames `instanceof` in below to something different, but it had a bug related to object patterns in assignments.
This is now fixed and the bundler will not break code using reserved works in object patterns.

## New feautres

### Support for legacy decorators on methods with computed keys ([#1347](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1347))

[swc][] now supports typescript code like

```ts
class Foo {
  @dec
  [bar]() {}
}
```

which uses decorator with computed keys.

### Support for TypeScript 4.2 ([#1330](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1330))

[swc][] now supports parsing and transcompiling typescript 4.2 files.
