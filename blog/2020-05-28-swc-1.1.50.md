## Bugfixes

_Note: prebuilt binaries for v1.1.49 are replaced with binaries from v1.1.48, to prevent breaking downstream crates._

### New reserved_words pass ([#805](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/805))

I made a serious mistake at `v1.1.49` which makes swc unusable. This patch fixes it.
