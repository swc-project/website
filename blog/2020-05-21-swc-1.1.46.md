## Bugfixes

### resolver: arrow expression ([#790](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/790))

`swc` had a bug that occurs if an arrow parameter and local binding has a same name. Due to the bug, code like

```js
window.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
  try {
    console.log(e.data);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
});
```

was miscompiled. It is now fixed.

### types in `as` expressions ([#787](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/787))

Previously, `swc` didn't detect type-only imports correctly if `as` is used. It means,

```ts
import { IPerson } from "../types/types";
export function createPerson(person: IPerson) {
  const a = {} as IPerson;
}
```

was compiled as

```js
import { IPerson } from "../types/types";
export function createPerson(person) {
  const a = {};
}
```

instead of

```js
export function createPerson(person) {
  const a = {};
}
```

Fix was quite simple. By making `swc` drop type before visiting whole expression, typescript type casting expressions are now stripped out.
