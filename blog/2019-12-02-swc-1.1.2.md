## Fixed a parser bug ([#480](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/480))

Previously, `swc`'s parser incorrectly parsed `1.09` as `1.9`. `swc` now parses it correctly.

## Preserve space in jsx ([#481](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/481))

Previousely,

```jsx
const a = <span> {foo}</span>;
```

was compield to

```js
const a = React.createElement("span", null, foo);
```

, which is wrong. Starting with `v1.1.2`, `swc` compiles it as

```js
const a = React.createElement("span", null, " ", foo);
```
