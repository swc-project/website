## Bugfixes

### typescript: async override ([#1558](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1558))

[swc][] now supports `async override` in addition to `override async`.

```ts
class Base {
    method1() {}
    method2() {}
}

class Test extends Base {
    public override async method1() {
        return Promise.resolve(1);
    }

    public async override method2() {
        return Promise.resolve(1);
    }
}
```

### dce bug ([#1533](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1533))

Previously [swc][] had a bug that causes a usage of a variable in the discriminant of a switch statement not treated as a usage.
It's now fixed and code like below works even if the optimizer is enabled.

```js
var this_will_disappear; // <-- this variable declaration disappears
function a(x) {
  switch (this_will_disappear) {
    case x:
      return;
  }
}
function b() {
  c();
}
function c() {
  b();
  d();
}
function d() {
  a();
}
```

### SIGILL ([#1583](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1583))

[swc][] used `aes` feature of cpus as an optimization, but it caused `SIGILL` on a user's pc.
So I disabled `aes` feature.

### Logical nullish assigments ([#1570](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1570))

```ts
const a: { [a: string]: string } = {};
a.b ??= "1";
console.log(a); // expect: { b: '1' }
```

The code above was miscompieled by [swc][], but it's now fixed.

### Order of statements regarding imports ([#1457](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1457))

[swc][] now preserve order of statements even if there are some imports.
This is to fix code like

```ts
import {
  setGlobalOptions,
  plugin,
  buildSchema,
  addModelToTypegoose,
  deleteModel,
} from "@typegoose/typegoose";
import * as typegoose from "@typegoose/typegoose";
// typegoose.mongoose.set('debug', true);
setGlobalOptions({
  options: {
    allowMixed: typegoose.Severity.ALLOW,
  },
  schemaOptions: {
    timestamps: {
      createdAt: "created_at",
      updatedAt: "updated_at",
    },
  },
});
import { schemas } from "./schemas";
```

### Syntax context of super classes ([#1586](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1586))

[swc][] had a bug which makes

```ts
class Foo {}
class Test extends Foo {
  foo() {
    console.log(Foo);
  }
}
Foo = 3;
new Foo().foo();
```

to emit `Foo` instead of 3.

It's fixed by [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett).

### Statement order of default imports. ([#1568](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1568))

To workaroudn [a bug of webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7767), I modified order of statements generated from `export default function`s.

Thankfully, [@josteph](https://github.com/josteph) explained the problem and suggested the way to fix.

### Mixed import of default ([#1525](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1525))

```ts
import { Component, default as React } from "react";

class X extends Component {}

React.render(document.getElementById("root"), <X></X>);
```

[swc][] previously miscompied this, because it wasn't careful enough about `default as Foo`-style imports.
It's fixed and [swc][] now emits

```js
var _react = _interopRequireWildcard(require("react"));

class X extends _react.Component {}
_react.default.render(
  document.getElementById("root"),
  /*#__PURE__*/ _react.default.createElement(X, null)
);
```

which is correct.

### SourceMaps ([#1581](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1581))

[swc][] had a bug related to inline source maps and as a result it generated empty sourcemap.
It's fixed.

### Parameter property decorators ([#1456](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1456))

[swc][] had a bug in logic for determining if it should work.
While checking existance of decortor, [swc][] didn't check decorators of typescript parameter properties.

As a result, decorator didn't work if **all** constructor parameters are parameter properties.
It's now fixed and decorators are properly applied.

### Fix for `arguments` ([#1585](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1585))

There was a bug of [swc][] which may break some codes using arguments in arrow functions.

It could break codes like

```js
function test() {
  return () => arguments[0];
}
```

Fixed by [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett).

### Fix for decorators ([#1362](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1362))

Fixed as a part of decorator fixes.
