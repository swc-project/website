## AST

### TsExpressionWithTypeArguments

`TsExpressionWithTypeArguments` has `typeArguments` instead of `typeParams`. This is _technically_ breaking change, but I didn't bumped major version because I don't think the change break real world code.

## Parser

### span of import / export ([#540](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/540))

Spans of import statements and export statements are fixed.

### span of await in for-of statement ([#551](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/551))

Spans of `await` token in for-of statement is fixed.

### readonly properties in class ([#547](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/547))

Previously,

```ts
class Foo {
  readonly t: string;
}
```

was parsed as

```ts
class Foo {
  t: string;
}
```

But from now on, it's correctly parsed as readonly.

### import.meta ([#545](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/545))

`swc` now accepts

```js
const test = import.meta.someProp;
```

and

```js
import.meta.someProp;
```

## Codegen

### default import with namespace ([#546](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/546))

Previously,

```js
import availabilities, * as availabilityFunctions from "reducers/availabilities";
```

is printed as

```js
import availabilities* as availabilityFunctions from 'reducers/availabilities';
```

which is wrong. It is now printed correctly as

```js
import availabilities, * as availabilityFunctions from "reducers/availabilities";
```

### indent after line comment ([#544](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/544))

It means,

```js
function b() {
  // comment
  a = 1;
}
```

is preserved. Previously, indent after a line comment was removed.

## Transforms

### regenerator ([#554](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/554))

`transform-regenerator` (from babel) is implemented in swc, and invoked automatically if you target `es3` or `es5`.

### whitespace after inner JSX tag is preserved ([#542](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/542))

```js
let page = (
  <p>
    Click <em>New melody</em> listen to a randomly generated melody
  </p>
);
```

is compiled as

```js
var page = React.createElement(
  "p",
  null,
  "Click ",
  React.createElement("em", null, "New melody"),
  " listen to a randomly generated melody"
);
```

instead of

```js
var page = React.createElement(
  "p",
  null,
  "Click ",
  React.createElement("em", null, "New melody"),
  "listen to a randomly generated melody"
);
```

which is wrong.
