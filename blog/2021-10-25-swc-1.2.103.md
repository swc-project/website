## Improvements

### `minifier`: Name mangler

I reimplemented the name mangler, and now compression rate is on par with terser.

Implemented by [#2509](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2509).

### `browserslist` in `optionalDependencies`

`swc` now uses `optionalDependencies` correctly.

Implemented by [@iheyunfei](https://github.com/iheyunfei) and by [#2515](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2515).

### single-property destructuring

`swc` now compiles

```js
const { NODE_ENV } = process.env;
```

as

```js
const NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV;
```

Implemented by [#2511](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2511).

### FreeBSD build

`swc` now supports FreeBSD again.

Implemented by [@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn) and by [#2497](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2497).

## Bugfixes

### `async_to_generator`: for await in async generators ([#2306](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2306))

Previously `swc` could break code like below, because it did not consider the type of function while handling for-await loops.

```ts
async function* g1(): AsyncGenerator<string> {
  yield "OK";
  yield "OK";
  yield "OK";
}

async function* g2(): AsyncGenerator<string> {
  for await (const g of g1()) {
    yield g;
  }
}

for await (const g of g2()) {
  console.log(g);
}
```

Fixed by [#2526](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2526).

### `inline_globals`: Assignment to `process.env` ([#2499](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2499))

Previously, `inline_globals` did not consider assignment context, and it resulted in a bug if one tries to assign value to e.g. `process.env.NODE_ENV`.

Affected code looks like

```js
process.env.FOO = "bar";
```

and it's now fixed by [#2524](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2524).

### `bundler`: Named export

Previously, the import analyzer did not mark `foo` in `export { foo }` as unknown-access, and it broke the code if it was the only use.

Reproduction case looks like

```js
// temp.js
import { foo } from "./temp2.js";
foo.hello(1);

// temp2.js
import * as foo from "./temp3.js";
export { foo };
foo.hello(2);

// temp3.js
export function hello(n) {
  console.log("Hello", n);
}
```

Fixed by [#2510](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2510).

### `bundler`: cjs helper ([#2517](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2517))

There was a regression of bundler, and the bug could break code using common js imports.

Fixed by [#2518](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2518).

### react fast refresh

Previously react fast refresh has a bug related to the span hygiene which is the own system of swc for managing variables.

Fixed by [#2501](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2501).

### typescript: `import A = B`

Previously, `swc` could break code using `import A = foo.bar`.

Fixed by [@nayeemrmn](https://github.com/nayeemrmn) and by [#2496](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2496)

### this in class fields ([#2344](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2344))

Previously, `swc` could break code like

```js
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log("this is:", this);
  };

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>;
  }
}
```

because it has a bug related to `this` in arrows in class properties.

Fixed by [@Austaras](https://github.com/Austaras) and by [#2514](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2514)

### minifier: Various bugs

I used the tests for the deno bundler to test minifier, and fixed some bugs.

See [#2503](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2503) for mor details.
