## Bugfixes

### variable analyzer

Due to recent changes, there was a regression in the variable analyzer.

In the code below,

```ts
const bar = () => {
  console.log(a);
};

const { a = b } = foo;
```

if a pass before variable analyzer drops `b`, it resulted in a bug because `{ a }` is different from `{ a = <n/a> }`.

Fixed by [#2448](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2448).

### ecapes in jsx ([#2351](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2351))

The escape in jsx is fixed.

Fixed by [#2447](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2447).

### minifier: `let` ([#2446](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2446))

Previously the minifier may made a variable named `let`.

Fixed by [#2447](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2447).
