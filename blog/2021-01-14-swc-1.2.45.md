## Bugfixes

### Escapes in string literals ([#1227](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1227))

This was a regression caused by some works related to span (and sourcemaps). I fixed it and [swc][] can emit es5 code as before.

### Panic on aliased reexports ([#1307](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1307))

This is a regresssion caused by promoting namespaced re-exports like (`export * as foo from 'foo'`) to `es2020` from `esnext`. This is now fixed.

### Private class properties ([#1306](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1306))

[swc][] previously miscompiled

```ts
class Animal {
  readonly #name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.#name = name;
  }

  public noise() {
    return this.#name.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```

but now [swc][] compiles it correctly. Actaully the fix was addition of one line.

### Preserve imports ([#1134](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1134))

This is also a regression, but it's now fixed.

## Features

### Support for typescript namespace ([#1325](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1325))

[swc][] now supports typescript namespace.
