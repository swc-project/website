## Bugfixes

### preset-env: non-swcrc config ([#783](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/783))

Previously if you use `transformSync` without a file name, configuration related to preset-env was ignored. This is obviously wrong and it's fixed with `v1.1.45`.

## UX Improvements

### Better error message ([#781](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/781))

When `swcrc` file contains invalid value, `swc` prints a more detailed error message. Note that although `swc` supports specifing multiple entries in the `.swcrc` file, error message for multiple item is not improved yet.

```
    failed to load config for file 'SourceFile(/Users/kdy1/projects/node-swc/__tests__/../tests/error/simple.js)'

    Caused by:
        0: failed to deserialize .swcrc (json) file: unmatched data: 2:6
        1: unknown field `js`, expected one of `env`, `test`, `exclude`, `jsc`, `module`, `minify` at line 2 column 6
```
