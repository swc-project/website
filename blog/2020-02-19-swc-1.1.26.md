## Bugfix

### recursive function reference within a method property ([#679](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/678))

Previously, codes like below can crash swc.

```js
({
  foo() {
    function bar() {
      bar;
    }
  }
});
```

This is fixed with `@v1.1.26`.

### await-for loop

`swc` emits identical code as babel when it meets an await-for loop.

```js
for await (const row of stream) {
}
```
