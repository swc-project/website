## Bugfixes

### block scoping ([#604](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/604))

`swc` had a serious bug bug.

`swc` compiled

```js
let functions = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  functions.push(function() {
    console.log(i);
  });
}
functions[0]();
functions[7]();
```

as

```js
var functions = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  functions.push(function() {
    console.log(i);
  });
}
functions[0]();
functions[7]();
```

which is wrong. By tracking idetifier usages in nested function, `swc` now emits correct output.

New output is very simillar to the one of `babel`.

```js
var _loop = function(i) {
  functions.push(function() {
    console.log(i);
  });
};
var functions = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) _loop(i);
functions[0]();
functions[7]();
```

### hygiene ([#604](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/604))

Use-use conflict detection introduced in `v1.1.14` had a serious bug. Some identifiers like `Object` are inherently used multiple time. It resulted in an use-use conflict and there was a bug.
By making an use-bind conflict for global objects, `swc` can handle a code like

```js
function foo(Object) {
  Object.foo();
}
```

It will be compiled as

```js
function foo(Object1) {
  Object1.foo();
}
```

to make other usages of native identifier safe.
