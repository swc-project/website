## Improvements

### Support for `new.target` ([#1179](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1179))

swc now supports transforming `new.target`. It uses test suite from babel, and all tests are passing.

Implemented by [#2129](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2129).

### `jsc.experimental.optimizeHygiene` ([#1600](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1600), [#2137](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2137))

Previously swc renamed lots of variable, but you can now speficy `jsc.experimental.optimizeHygiene` to make swc rename only if required.

Implemented by [#2145](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2145).

## Bugfixes

### bundler: Reexports from common js modules ([#2124](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2124))

Previously the bundler fails to handle esm reexports from cjs modules.

Fixed by [#2143](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2143).
