## Bugfixes

### typescript strip pass ([#800](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/800))

Previously, `swc` did not drop type parameters in classes. This caused

```ts
export class FeatureSet<Name extends string> {
  log(a: Name) {
    console.log(a);
  }
}
```

to be compiled as

```ts
export class FeatureSet<Name extends string> {
  log(a) {
    console.log(a);
  }
}
```

which is obviously not a valid javascript. This is now fixed and `swc` emits

```js
export class FeatureSet {
  log(a) {
    console.log(a);
  }
}
```

### (new) reserved words pass ([#801](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/801))

Previously `swc` did not handle keywords if you target es5+. But it's wrong because es2019 also has reserved words.
So I added a new pass to rename reserved words.

Problematic codes include

```ts
export class Foo {
  delete(object: string, key: string) {
    delete object[key];
  }
}
```

### block scoping pass ([#803](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/803))

The `block_scoping` pass emits almost identical output with babel. It can now handle continue, break and return correctly.
