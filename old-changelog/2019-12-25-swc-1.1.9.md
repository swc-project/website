## Legacy decorator ([#421](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/421))

You can now use decorators from typescrip. You don't need to configure anything. However, decorators on object are not supported yet and I don't think it worth as making parser to accept obsolute syntax may result in bugs.

Also, you can use it from ecmascript too. If you want it, you should set `jsc.transform.legacyDecorator` to true.
