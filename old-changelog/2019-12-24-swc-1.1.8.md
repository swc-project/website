## Optional Chaining ([#525](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/525))

As this is stage 4, it's automatically enabled.

You can write code like

```js
a?.b?.c;
```

in ecmascript too. Previously it was possible only in typescript.

## Nullish coalescing ([#526](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/526))

As this is stage 3, you need to set `jsc.parser.nullishCoalescing` to true to use it.

`swc` can now handle `??` operator.

```js
const someValue = myOtherValue ?? "default value";
```

is compield as

```js
const someValue =
  myOtherValue !== null && myOtherValue !== void 0
    ? myOtherValue
    : "default value";
```

## BigInt literals ([#520](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/520))

As this is stage 4, it's automatically enabled.

```js
4n + 10n;
```

This is also usable from typescript without any additional configuration.

## Numeric separators ([#521](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/521))

As this is stage 3, you need to set `jsc.parser.numericSeparator` to true to use it.

Long numeric literals can be written as

```js
10_200;
0b10101_0001;
0xa0_b0_c0;
```

## Comments improvements ([#528](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/528))

Comments on paren expressions are moved to inner expresssion correctly.

```js
// bar
[
  // foo
  a,

  //bar
  (
    //baz
    b
  )
];
```

is compiled as

```js
// bar
[
  // foo
  a,

  //bar
  //baz
  b
];
```
