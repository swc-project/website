## Improvements

### typescript: ergonomic branch check

`swc` now supports ergonomic branch checks for typescript.

Enabled by [@dsherret](https://github.com/dsherret) and by [#2562](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2562).

## Bugfixes

### name mangler

Previously the name mangler treated a catch clause as a scope, but it's wrong thing to do.

Fixed by [#2557](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2557)
