## Bugfixes

### `paths` (from `tsconfig.json`) ([#1858](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1858))

The support for `paths` is implemented in `v1.2.62` but actually there was a bug and it's now also tested from node side codes.
Previously only rust-side tests existed.

Fixed by [#1932](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1932)

### input source map ([#1930](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1930))

`swc` can now input sourcemap correctly.

Fixed by [#1932](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1932)

### regenerator: Fix for helpers ([#1924](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1924))

Pass ordering was wrong and it could cause problem if the **only** helper used comes from `regenerator` pass.

Fixed by [@IronLu233](https://github.com/IronLu233) and by [#1931](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1931).

### rest patterns in arrow functions ([#1926](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1926))

Now codes like

```ts
const foo = (...args) => {
  console.log(args);
};
```

will work.
