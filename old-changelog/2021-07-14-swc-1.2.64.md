## Bugfixes

### Optional chaining ([#1882](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1882))

Previously swc had a bug related to nested optional chaining expressions.

```js
const button = renderedView.find(LoadingButton);
button?.prop('onClick')?.({} as any);
```

Fixed by [@kwonoj](https://github.com/kwonoj) and by [#1899](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1899).

### Visitor bug ([#1886](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1886))

The type definition for object patterns were wrong and it's fixed by [#1900](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1900).

### codegen: private static properties ([#1898](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1898))

### Export default function with async ([#1799](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1799))

Previously if you target old version and use async function in a named `export default function`-s, swc didn't create a variable with same name.

Affected code looks like

```js
import React from "react";

export default function Foo() {
  return (
    <div
      onClick={async (e) => {
        await doSomething();
      }}
    ></div>
  );
}

Foo.displayName = "Foo";
```

Fixed by [#1900](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1900).

### optional chaining with single-line arrow ([#1836](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1836))

Previously code like

```ts
function bug() {
  const arrowFn = (arg) => this.object[arg]?.();
}

bug();
```

was broken because variables are wrongly injected.

Fixed by [#1900](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1900).

### decorator ([#1278](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1278))

swc now initializes decorators right before they are applied.

This change allows referencing the class from decorator.

```ts
type Klass<T = any> = { new (...args: any[]): T };
function MyDecorator(klass: Klass): PropertyDecorator {
  return () => {
    // do something
    console.log(klass);
  };
}

class MyClass {
  @MyDecorator(MyClass) prop: "";
}

console.log(new MyClass());
```

Fixed by [#1905](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1905).

### regenerator: Exeception ([#1892](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1892))

Old versions of swc incorrectly throwed an error for a specific code.

Fixed by [@kwonoj](https://github.com/kwonoj) and by [#1906](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1906)

### regenerator: Respect module config ([#1641](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1641))

`swc` now emits dependency for `regenerator-runtime` as es import statement, which is technically wrong but works because bundlers handle it.

### regenerator: unused codes ([#1687](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1687))

Previously `swc` emitted useless codes.

Fixed by [#1909](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1909).

### typeof undefined ([#1843](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1843))

Previously `swc` could break a program if it uses `typeof` in specific way.

Fixed by [#1909](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1909).

### proper helpers ([#1682](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1682))

Previously module transforms were too naive and as a result could break some code.

Fixed by [#1909](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1909)

### export \* with named overrides ([#1714](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1714))

swc now allows overriding `export *` with named exports.

Code like below will work properly.

```ts
import { customRender } from "./customRender";

// re-export everything
export * from "@testing-library/react";

// override render method
export { customRender as render };
```

### decorators for class properties ([#1913](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1913))

Previsouly `swc` could break codes like

```ts
import { action } from "mobx";

class Store {
  constructor() {
    this.doSomething();
  }

  @action
  doSomething = () => {
    console.log("run");
  };
}

const store = new Store();
```

Fixed by [@IronLu233](https://github.com/IronLu233) and by [#1914](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1914).

### await expressions as callee

Previously swc could break code like

```ts
new (await foo())();
```

Fixed by [#1919](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1919).
