## Bugfixes

### Import / export orders are preserved ([#1069](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1069))

Previously [swc][] can break codes if you use es6 circular imports.
As circular imports are not used widely, it was undetected.

The affected code looks like

```js
import "reflect-metadata";

export * from "./http";
export { id } from "./interfaces";
```
