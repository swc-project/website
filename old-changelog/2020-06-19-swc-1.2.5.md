## Bugfixes

### regenerator ([#851](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/851))

Previously, the code below was miscompiled by swc because of the performance optimizartion. The wrong optimization is removed and the code below now works.s

```js
function* gen() {
  yield 1;
}
function genFactory() {
  return function* () {
    yield 1;
  };
}
console.log(gen().next());
```
