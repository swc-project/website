## Improvements

### sourcemap

Now `swc` does not emit `sourceContents` in situations where `sources` is enough.
Additionally, `swc` now emits `names` properly.

## Bugfixes

### `||` in `await` ([#2155](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2155))

Fixed by [#2157](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2157)

### `minify`: Options for terser compat ([#2153](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2153))

When using `@swc/core` via yarn resolution, it may resulted in an error because of some terser options.
`swc` now accepts this option and ignores them (for now), so it does not result in a json deserialization error.

Fixed by [#2158](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2158)

### `parser`: Generics with jsx ([#2161](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2161))

Previously, `swc` failed to pares

```ts
const x = <P extends object>(
  a: React.ComponentType<P>
): React.ComponentType<P & { a: string }> => React.memo();
```

Fixed by [#2166](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2166)

### `codegen`: Assignment as an arrow body ([#2163](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2163))

Previously `swc` could break code like

```js
() => ({ foo } = bar());
```

Fixed by [#2166](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2166)

### `expr_simplifier`: Assignments with operator ([#2165](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2165))

Previsouly `swc` mis-optimized

```js
var bit = 0;
var sum = 0;
sum += (bit ^= 1) ? 0 : 1;
sum += (bit ^= 1) ? 0 : 1;
console.log(sum);
```

because it didn't check the operator of assignment while caculating value of an expression.

Fixed by [#2166](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2166)
