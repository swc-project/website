## Bugfixes

### catch parameter in regenerator ([#854](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/854))

While porting regenerator, I forgot handling catch parameters. The bug was that `swc` does not touch `e` in the code below.

```js
function throwingFn() {
  throw "Error";
}
function* gen() {
  try {
    yield throwingFn();
  } catch (e) {
    yield e;
  }
}
console.log(gen().next());
```

It's now fixed and works correctly.

## New features

### es2020 output ([#847](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/847))

Optional chaining and nullish coalescing are enabled by default, and if you want to emit those as-is, you can now specify `target: "es2020"`.
