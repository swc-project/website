## Removed random panic ([#672](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/672))

`swc` internally maintain positions information in a struct named SourceMap.
Previously, it had a bug that different files have overlapping spans when `new_source_file` is called concurrently.
It was fixed by introducing an atomic variable.

## Fixed source map of async generator ([#669](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/669))

`swc` previously had a bug which generated invalid source map for the code below.

```js
function* foo() {
  try {
    return yield call();
  } finally {
  }
}
```
