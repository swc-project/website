## Improvements

### Performance

- Now swc uses faster hashing algorithms in various places. (([#2073](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2073)))

## Bugfixes

### Mangling of private properties ([#2086](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2086))

### `function` as a property name ([#2075](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2075))

Previously, swc fails to parse if `jsx` is enabled and `function` is used as a property key in jsx experssions.

It broke code like

```ts
const x = <div onclick={(e) => ({ function: 123 })}></div>;
```

or

```ts
const x = <div onclick={{ function: 123 }}></div>;
```

Fixed by [#2076](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2076).

### Type definitions ([#1947](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1947))

Typings for swc api is improved.

Fixed by [#2077](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2077).

### bundler: Stack overflow ([#1963](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1963))

Previously bundler wrongly recursed into some functions and it resulted in a stack overflow.

Fixed by [#2080](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2080)

### minifier bugs ([#2072](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2072), [#2078](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2078))

Previsouly the minifier could break some valid programs, like

```ts
let rerenderQueue = [1];
let queue;

while (rerenderQueue.length > 0) {
  queue = rerenderQueue.sort();
  rerenderQueue = [];
  queue.forEach((c) => console.log(c));
}
```

(#2708)

or

```ts
function cost(oldItem, newItem) {
  if (newItem.val === oldItem.val) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (typeof oldItem.val === "object" && typeof newItem.val === "object") {
    if (oldItem.key === undefined || newItem.key === undefined) {
      return 1;
    }
    if (oldItem.key === newItem.key) {
      return 0;
    }
  }
  return 1;
}
```

(#2072)

Fixed by [#2058](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2058)

### `inline_globals` ([#1294](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1294))

Previsouly, `__DEBUG__` in

```ts
var __DEBUG__ = "hi";
console.log(__DEBUG__);
```

was replaced with the value declared in `.swcrc`, but it is wrong because local declarations should have higher priorities than global config.

Fixed by [#2058](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2058)

### bundler: `browser`

The bundler of swc now supports using object for `browser` in `package.json`.

Fixed by [@tmpfs](https://github.com/tmpfs) and by [#2060](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2060)
