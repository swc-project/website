## General improvements

### Support optional named tuple elements ([#982](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/982))

TypeScript 4 allows

```ts
type Foo = [first: number, second?: string, ...rest: any[]];
```

and [swc][] now supports it.

### Better error messages ([#980](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/980))

Error messages were crpytic, mainly because I'm too lazy. Anyway, it's finally got improved.

```
error: Unexpected token Some(Semi)
 --> $DIR/tests/typescript-errors/type-arguments/input.ts:1:9
  |
1 | new A<T>;
```

becomes

```
error: Unexpected token `;`. Expected this, import, async, function, [ for array literal, { for object literal, @ for decorator, function, class, null, true, false, number, bigint, string, regexp, ` for template literal, (, or an identifier
 --> $DIR/tests/typescript-errors/type-arguments/input.ts:1:9
  |
1 | new A<T>;
```

## Performance improvement

### Performance of swc is improved ([#992](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/992))

Previously, [swc][] spend all time moving the memory with `memmove`. I've managed to remove some memmoves.
Also, panic cases are handled properly.

For example, I changed code from

```rust

let prev = match self.cur.take() {
    Some(t) => t,

    None => unreachable!(
        "Current token is `None`. Parser should not call bump()without knowing current \
          token"
    ),
};
```

to

```rust

#[cold]
#[inline(never)]
fn invalid_state() -> ! {
    unreachable!(
        "Current token is `None`. Parser should not call bump() without knowing current \
          token"
    )
}

let prev = match self.cur.take() {
    Some(t) => t,

    None => invalid_state(),
};
```

This technique aids cpu cache issue.

### sse2 is enabled

It drastically reduces times used to memmove.

### Performance of spack is improved ([#992](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/992), [#972](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/972))

Some design flaws are fixed, it's fully parallelzed, and it does not transform files from node_modules.

### Binary size is reduced ([#973](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/973))

Some useless allocations are removed, some memmoves are removed.
Also, merging of reexports in spack now works in parallel manner.
