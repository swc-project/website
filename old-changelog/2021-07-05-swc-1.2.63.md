## Bugfixes

### common js: Duplicate named exports ([#1780](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1780))

Previously swc had a bug in common js handler which can break codes like

```ts
// constant.ts
export enum Foo {}
```

```ts
// File1.ts
export { Foo } from "./constant";
```

```ts
// file2.ts
export { Foo } from "./constant";
```

```ts
// index.ts
export const BIZ = "biz";
export * from "./file1";
export * from "./file2";
```

Fixed by [#1846](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1846) and by [@IronLu233](https://github.com/IronLu233).

### typescript: `<` and `>` in template literal types. ([#1862](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1862))
