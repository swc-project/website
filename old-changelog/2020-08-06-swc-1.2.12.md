## Bugfixes

### computed constructors ([#933](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/933))

Codes like

```js
new (eval("Date"))();
```

is affected.

## spack

### Conditional require ([#937](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/937))

You can now use spack for client-side applications, too.
Previously, codes like

```js
if (!Object.defineProperty) {
  require("./object-property-shim");
}
```

make `spack` crash, but it's fixed and you can use spack with a client-side library like react.

## Improvements

### Reduced size ([#928](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/928))

`swc` now uses `opt-level = 'z'` to reduce size. It results in a massive size reduction.
