## Bugfixes

### Usage of static property in decorators ([#824](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/824))

```ts
import { Debounce } from "lodash-decorators";
class Person {
  private static debounceTime: number = 500 as const;
  @Debounce(Person.debounceTime)
  save() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
  }
}
const p = new Person();
p.save();
```

Previously, the code above throws an error if it's compiled with `swc` and works if it's compiled with `tsc`.
The bug is now fixed, and `swc` can compile the code correctly.
