## Bugfixes

### Dead code elimination ([#760](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/760))

Previously, dead code elimination pass of `swc` was buggy and removed some used codes.

The root cause was incorrect management of a state variable, and it is fixed by [#762](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/762)
