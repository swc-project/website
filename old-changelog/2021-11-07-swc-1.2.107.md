## Improvements

## Bugfixes

### static blocks: Improved output

Previously `swc` emitted

```js
class Foo {
  static #_ = 42;
  static #_1 = 42;
  static #_12 = (() => {
    this.foo = this.#_;
    this.bar = this.#_1;
  })();
}
```

for

```js
class Foo {
  static #_ = 42;
  static #_1 = 42;
  static {
    this.foo = this.#_;
    this.bar = this.#_1;
  }
}
```

Now `swc` emits

```js
class Foo {
  static #_ = 42;
  static #_1 = 42;
  static #_2 = (() => {
    this.foo = this.#_;
    this.bar = this.#_1;
  })();
}
```

### typings: `es6` module ([#2633](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2633))

Previously there was a bug in type definitions which makes `tsc` angry about

```js
import * as swc from "@swc/core";
swc.transformSync("", {
  module: {
    type: "es6", // When this file is TypeScript, the typechecker complains about this line
  },
});
```

Fixed by [@magic-akari](https://github.com/magic-akari) and by [#2648](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2648)

### pass ordering ([#2413](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2413))

There was a bug in pass order. `destructuring` should be applied before `regenerator`, but it was not.
This caused compile-time exception complaining about complex binding in catch clauses.

Fixed by [#2629](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2629).

### minifier: pass limit ([#2604](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2604), [#2605](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2605))

Previously the limit of minifier was 30, but it was too low.
It's now increased to 100.

Fixed by [#2610](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2610).

### minifier: Fix for `@ericblade/quagga2`

There was a bug in logic for determine if we negate a boolean.

Fixed by [#2597](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2597).

### minifier: Fix for `murmur2`

There was a bug in logic for inlining variable assignments.
This bug broke `murmur2` and `@emotion/react` which depends on `murmur2`.

Fixed by [#2637](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2637).

### minifier: Fix for `react-countup`

Previously the analyzer didn't treat assignment with operator as 'usage' and the optimizer dropped the assignment because the 'usage' count is 0.

Fixed by [#2625](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2625).

### `this` in object properties in arrow

Previously `this` finder of `swc` recursed into object properties, and broke code like

```js
const navigation = (path) => [
  {
    name: "Home",
    href: `/`,
    get current() {
      return this.href === path;
    },
  },
  {
    name: "Dashboard",
    href: `/dashboard`,
    get current() {
      return this.href === path;
    },
  },
];
```

by replacing `this` as `_this`.

Fixed by [#2634](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2634).

### typescript: Type in `export = Foo` ([#2613](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2613))

Previously `swc` didn't strip the types in `export =` out.
As a result, code like

```ts
export = function (foo: string, bar: number): boolean {
  return true;
};
```

was broken.

Fixed by [@kwonoj](https://github.com/kwonoj) and by [#2623](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2623)

### `export { default as name }` ([#2548](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2548))

Previously, `swc` might broke code like

```ts
export { default as f } from "./f";
export * from "./f";

export { default as g } from "./g";
export * from "./g";
```

Fixed by [@JeremyGrieshop](https://github.com/JeremyGrieshop) and by [#2583](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2583).

### Order of imports ([#2594](Ohttps://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2594))

Previously, `swc` could broke code like

```js
export * from "./A";
export * from "./B";
```

because it didn't preserve execution order of import/export statements.

Fixed by [@kwonoj](https://github.com/kwonoj) and by [#2598](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2598).

### Reassignment to exported functions ([#2606](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2606))

Previously, `swc` emitted

```js
export function warn() {
  throw new Error("this should not be called");
}
export const test = {};
export const test2 = {};
Object.defineProperty(test, "warn", {
  get: () => warn,
  set: (v) => {
    warn = v;
  },
});
Object.defineProperty(test2, "work", {
  get: () => warn,
  set: (v) => {
    warn = v;
  },
});
```

for

```ts
export function warn() {
  throw new Error("this should not be called");
}
export const test = {};
export const test2 = {};
Object.defineProperty(test, "warn", {
  get: () => warn,
  set: (v) => {
    (warn as any) = v;
  },
});
Object.defineProperty(test2, "work", {
  get: () => warn,
  set: (v) => {
    warn = v;
  },
});
```

which does not allow modifying `warn`.

`swc` now emits

```js
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true,
});
exports.warn = warn;
exports.test2 = exports.test = void 0;
function warn() {
  throw new Error("this should not be called");
}
const test = {};
exports.test = test;
const test2 = {};
exports.test2 = test2;
Object.defineProperty(test, "warn", {
  get: () => warn,
  set: (v) => {
    exports.warn = warn = v;
  },
});
Object.defineProperty(test2, "work", {
  get: () => warn,
  set: (v) => {
    exports.warn = warn = v;
  },
});
```

which allows modifying `warn`.

Fixed by [@kwonoj](https://github.com/kwonoj) and by [#2631](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2631).
