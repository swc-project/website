## Performance

### parser becomes 10% ~ 15% faster

`swc` uses a special technique copied from `rustc` to store identifers and spans compactly.
However, it's memory-performance tradeoff, and encoding and decoding is not super fast operation.
So, while _parsing_, swc use un-compact version of span, and uses compact version of span after parsing.
The make parser much faster.

### codegen with sourcemap becomes 80% faster

I designed `swc`'s core module to support merging multiple file into a file.
Because of the design, `swc` used a concurrent data structures while generating code.
But it was not enough for performance. I added a cache layer related to source map, and the layer makes swc much faster
