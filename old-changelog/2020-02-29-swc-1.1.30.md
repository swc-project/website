## Bugfix

### enum with initializer ([#694](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/694))

Previously, `swc` worked well with enum without an initilaizer, but enum with initilaizer was broken.
From now on, `swc` emits the same output as `tsc` for enum.

### Span of assignment pattern ([#693](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/693))

Thanks to [@dsherret](https://github.com/dsherret), span of an assignment pattern become exact.
