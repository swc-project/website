## Bugfixes

### Source map ([#835](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/835))

The source map is fixed. I verified that generated source map point the original source correctly by using [source map visualizer](https://sokra.github.io/source-map-visualization/).

### yield\* ([#833](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/833))

`regenerator` pass had a bug related to `yield*`.

Previously, `swc` broke code like

```js
function* gen() {
  yield* [1, 2, 3];
}
```

But it's fixed and the function above correctly yields 3 times.

### BigInt literals ([#837](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/837))

There was no integration test for bigint literals and the test suite failed to catch it.
Previously, due to the bug of swc_ecma_codegen, bigint literal cannot be printed

```js
var foo = 2n + 7n;
```
