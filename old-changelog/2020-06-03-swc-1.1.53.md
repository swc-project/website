## Bugfixes

### Parser improvements ([#816](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/816))

`swc` had a bug related to parsing of type annotations. This is fixed by the pr and `swc` can _really_ parse almost all typescript codes.

### class member named declare ([#822](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/822))

The code below is quite simple, but need some careful approach to parse it correctly, as declare is one of contextual keywords.

```ts
class A {
  declare() {}
}
```

`swc` can now parse class memebers named `declare`.

### Typescript enums ([#821](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/821))

`swc` miscompiled typescript enums if an enum member references other variant.

Affected code looks like

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up = 1,
  Down = 2,
  Left = Up + Down,
}
```

and it's now compiled as

```js
var Direction;
(function (Direction) {
    Direction[Direction['Up'] = 1] = 'Up';
    Direction[Direction['Down'] = 2] = 'Down';
    Direction[Direction['Left'] = 3] = 'Left';
})(Direction || (Direction = {}));"
```

which is exactly same as it of `tsc`.
