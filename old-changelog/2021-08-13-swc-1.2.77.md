## Improvements

### mimalloc

Now swc uses `mimalloc` instead of `jemalloc`.

Implemented by [@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn) and by [#2068](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2068).

### Better error handling ([#2035](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2035))

Due to the some initial misdesign, handling errors from swc was inconvinient.
You can now use the exception thrown from the swc node apis.

Implemented by [#2065](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2065).

### bundler: `paths` support

`options.jsc.paths` in `spack.config.js` is respected when resolving modules.

Implemented by [@tmpfs](https://github.com/tmpfs) and by [#2054](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2054).

## Bugfixes

### Type definition of `ImportDeclaration` ([#2059](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2059))

Previsouly typescript type definition did not contain the field `typeOnly`.

Fixed by [#2067](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2067).

### Optional chaining ([#2063](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2063))

Previously swc miscompiled optional chaining in some cases.

Fixed by [#2067](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2067).

### `class-validator` ([#1362](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1362))

Previously using `class-validator` with swc resulted in an error if decorator metadata is enabled but `reflect-metadata` is not imported.

Fixed by [#2055](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2055).

### async generator ([#1918](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1918))

Previosuly swc miscompiled code like

```js
let resolve;
let promise = new Promise((r) => (resolve = r));
let iterable = {
  [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    return {
      next() {
        return promise;
      },
    };
  },
};

(async () => {
  for await (let value of iterable) {
    console.log(value);
  }
})();

(async function () {
  resolve({ value: 0, done: false });
  promise = new Promise((r) => (resolve = r));

  await null;
  resolve({ value: 1, done: false });
  promise = new Promise((r) => (resolve = r));

  resolve({ value: undefined, done: true });
})();
```

This fix does not affect many users.

Fixed by [#2055](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2055).

### minifier bugs ([#2051](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2051), [#2011](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2011))

While mangling, shorthand properties are now handled corrctly, and some self-reassigning functions from swc or babel is now treated correctly.

Fixed by [#2052](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2052)
