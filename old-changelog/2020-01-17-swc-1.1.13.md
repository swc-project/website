## Bugfixes

### Class methods ([#579](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/579))

There was a bug of swc that identifiers in the body of class methods are not handled by resolver pass. It results in [a bug](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/578) and it's now fixed.

### jsx container ([#584](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/584))

Previously you cannot get the span of `{4}`. Instead, you can only get span of `4`.

```ts
const t = <test other={4} />;
```

This is fixed by [a pr](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/592), and you can now get the span of jsx expression container.

### hygiene ([#591](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/591))

Initialization of exported variable is now properly handled. Previously,

```ts
export class Example {
  @foo() bar = "1";
  @foo() baz = "2";
}
```

was miscompiled, while

```ts
class Example {
  @foo() bar = "1";
  @foo() baz = "2";
}
```

is compiled correctly (and tested). I added some tests to prevent regression.

## New features

### TypePredicate.asserts ([#567](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/567))

Starting with v1.1.13, `swc` can parse asserts type predicate.

```ts
function isString(x: unknown): asserts x is string {
  if (typeof x !== "string") throw new Error("Not a string.");
}
```

This is a feature of typescript 3.7. Also note that type is changed slightly.

```ts
export interface TsTypePredicate extends Node, HasSpan {
  type: "TsTypePredicate";

  // This is added
  asserts: boolean;

  paramName: TsThisTypeOrIdent;
  typeAnnotation: TsTypeAnnotation;
}
```

## Span improvements

Thanks to [@dsherret](https://github.com/dsherret), there are more span improvements.

### TypePredicate ([#580](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/580))

Previously starts of span of some type predicates started too early and it's now fixed so that the span points type predicate correctly.

### Class ([#581](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/581))

- Spans of class members and classes should include decorators.
- Fix hi position for class parameter properties.
- Fix span of members with accessibility.

### Jsx ([#582](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/582))

Span of jsx opening element, closing element, spread child, and expression containers are fixed.
