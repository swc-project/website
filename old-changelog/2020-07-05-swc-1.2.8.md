## Bugfixes

### Random pacic of spack ([#876](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/876))

I think it's completely fixed. The mutex mentioned in [the previous post](https://swc-project.github.io/blog/2020/07/01/swc-1.2.7#crash-of-spack-872httpsgithubcomswc-projectswcissues872) now protects both range and real values.
