## Bugfixes

### `hygiene` ([#2297](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2297))

There was an edge case I missed.

Fixed (again) by [#2299](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2299).

### `parser`: JSX ([#2264](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2264))

Previously `swc` sometimes collect the jsx text below as comments.

```tsx
const t = <Switch>// 1 /* 2 */</Switch>;
```

Fixed by [#2255](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2255).

### `parser`: Function in tsx ([#2237](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2237))

Previously the parser of `swc` failed to parse the input below.

```tsx
import React from "react";

export function Results() {
  return (
    <div>
      {[].map(() => {
        function onClick(): void {}

        return null;
      })}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Fixed by [#2255](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2255).

### `sourceMap: true` in `.swcrc` ([#2194](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2194))

Fixed by [#2292](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2292).
