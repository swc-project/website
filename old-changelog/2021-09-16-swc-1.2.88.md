## Improvements

### minifier

I ported some more minification rules.

## Bugfixes

### typescript: `import =` ([#2234](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2234))

Previously `swc` miscompiled

```ts
import polygons = Shapes.Polygons;
let sq = new polygons.Square();
```

Fixed by [#2249](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2249).

### `this` in class properties ([#2228](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2228))

Previsouly, `swc` broke code if a class property in a child class uses `this`.

e.g.

```js
export default class extends Wepy {
  events = {
    "abc: click": function abcClick() {
      this.data = 123;
      console.log("abc");
    },
  };

  setData() {
    this.data = 456;
  }
}
```

Fixed by [#2249](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2249).

### minifier: `RegExp`

The minifier had a bug related to handling of `RegExp`, and it could break some codes.

Fixed by [#2229](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2229).
