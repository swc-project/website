## Bugfixes

### Various dce bugs ([#1301](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1301))

The dead code elimination pass of [swc][] was too aggressive and it broke some code.
It's now overly conservative, and I'll improve it over time.

### Small bundler rework ([#1318](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1318))

The [swc][] project uses very creatitve (and strange) approach to handle scoping issue because rust does not allow two mutable reference to same data.
Previously, the bundler of [swc][] tried to do something smart. I patched it to depend on the approach I mentioned and as a result, almost all bugs are fixed.
