## AST

### GetterProperty ([#557](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/557))

The code below is a valid typescript file.

```ts
const obj = {
  get test(): string {
    return "";
  }
};
```

Now swc's `GetterProperty` has a field named `typeAnnotation` and swc can parse it correctly.

### TsImportType ([#560](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/560))

Import type havs type arguments rather than type params.

## Parser

Thanks to [@dsherret](https://github.com/dsherret), may span-related bugs of parser is fixed.

### Span of patterns ([#558](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/558))

Span of patterns are fixed.

### Span of classes and interfaces ([#566](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/566))

Span of classes and interfaces are fixed.

### Comments on last statement ([#555](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/555))

Previously comments before `}` was removed silently.

```js
if (true) {
}
// 2
```

### Wrong error messages are removed ([#574](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/574))

```ts
const fn = <T extends string | number>(x: T) => x;
```

is a valid typescript code. `swc` emitted an error like

```
error: TS1109
 --> index.ts:1:30
  |
1 | const fn = <T extends string | number>(x: T) => x;
  |
```

The error is removed.

## Transforms

### Nested if statement ([#565](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/565))

`swc` optimizes javascript file if possible. But there was a bug related to it.

```js
if (x) {
  if (y) log(1);
  else if (z) log(2);
} else log(3);
```

was miscompiled as

```js
if (x)
  if (y) log(1);
  else if (z) log(2);
  else log(3);
```

From now, braces are correctly preserved and `swc` emits

```js
if (x) {
  if (y) log(1);
  else if (z) log(2);
} else log(3);
```
