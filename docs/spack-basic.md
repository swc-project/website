# Changes of name

The bundler of swc was called `spack`, but it will be changed to `swcpack`.
[There's a project called spack](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1113), and it's much older than the bundler, so I think it's right to rename new tool.

The support for `spack.config.js` will be dropped in v2. It will be `swcpack.config.js` instead, although the new config file is not supported yet.

## Config file

spack can be configured with `spack.config.js`. Config file for the spack is almost simillar to webpack. In future, I'll add a webpack-compatible plugin system.

Currently configuration items should be exported as common js exports, like

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    web: __dirname + "/src/index.ts",
  },
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/lib",
  },
};
```

> Note: In future, exporting config using ES modules will be supported.

If you want autocompletion or type checking for configuration, you can wrap with `config` function from `@swc/core/spack`. It's an identity function with type annotation.

```ts
const { config } = require("@swc/core/spack");

module.exports = config({
  entry: {
    web: __dirname + "/src/index.ts",
  },
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/lib",
  },
});
```

### `mode`

Possible values: `production`, `debug`, `none`.

Currently this value is not used, but it will behave similarly to one of webpack.

### `entry`

Determines the entry of bundling.
You may specify a file or a map of bundle name to file path.

> Note: Currently this should be absolute path. You can use `__dirname` to create one.
>
> But in future, spack will support using relative path and will resolve files relative to `spack.config.js`.

#### Example

```ts
const { config } = require("@swc/core/spack");

module.exports = config({
  entry: __dirname + "/src/index.ts",
});
```

You can specify the name of bundle like following.

```ts
const { config } = require("@swc/core/spack");

module.exports = config({
  entry: {
    web: __dirname + "/src/index.ts",
  },
});
```

### `output`

You can change destination directory of the bundler using `output`.

#### Example

```ts
const { config } = require("@swc/core/spack");

module.exports = config({
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/lib",
    // Name is optional.
    name: "index.js",
  },
});
```

<!-- ### `module`

This option is currently not supported. -->

<!-- ### `optimization`

This option is currently buggy. -->

<!-- ### `resolve`

This option is currently not supported. -->

### `options`

Used to control the behavior of swc. This field is optional.

See [Options section of the swc doc](/docs/usage-core#options) for details.
