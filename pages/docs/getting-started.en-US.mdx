# Getting Started

## Installation

The easiest way to try SWC is using the [Playground](/playground).

Otherwise, run the following to download pre-built binaries:

```plaintext
npm i -D @swc/cli @swc/core
```

Then, you can transpile your first file and emit to `stdout`:

```plaintext
npx swc ./file.js
```

- Mac (Apple Silicon)
- Mac (x64)
