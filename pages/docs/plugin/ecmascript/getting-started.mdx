# Implementing a plugin

## Setup environment

### Install required toolchain

As plugin is written in the rust programming language and built as a `.wasm` file, you need to install rust toolchain and wasm target.

#### Install rust

You can follow instructions at ['Install Rust' page from the official rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

#### Add wasm target to rust

SWC supports two kinds of `.wasm` files.
Those are

- wasm32-wasi
- wasm32-unknown-unknown

In this guide, we will use `wasm-wasi` as a target.

#### Install `swc_cli`

You can install a rust-based CLI for SWC by doing

```sh
cargo install swc_cli
```

#### Configuring IDE

If you are going to use vscode, it's recommended to install `rust-analyzer` extension.
`rust-analyzer` is a [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for the rust programming langauge, which provides good features for code completion, code navigation, and code analysis.

## Implementing simple plugin

### Create a project

SWC CLI supports creating a new plugin project.

Run

```
swc plugin new --target-type wasm32-wasi my-first-plugin
```

to create a new plugin, and open `my-first-plugin` with your preferred rust IDE.

### Implementing a visitor

The generated code has

```rust
impl VisitMut for TransformVisitor {
    // Implement necessary visit_mut_* methods for actual custom transform.
    // A comprehensive list of possible visitor methods can be found here:
    // https://rustdoc.swc.rs/swc_ecma_visit/trait.VisitMut.html
}
```

which is used to transform code.
[The trait `VisitMut`](https://rustdoc.swc.rs/swc_ecma_visit/trait.VisitMut.html) supports mutating AST nodes, and as it supports all AST types, it has lots of methods.

---

We will use

```js
foo === bar;
```

as the input. From [the SWC Playground](https://play.swc.rs), you can get actual representation of this code.

```json
{
  "type": "Module",
  "span": {
    "start": 0,
    "end": 12,
    "ctxt": 0
  },
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "ExpressionStatement",
      "span": {
        "start": 0,
        "end": 12,
        "ctxt": 0
      },
      "expression": {
        "type": "BinaryExpression",
        "span": {
          "start": 0,
          "end": 11,
          "ctxt": 0
        },
        "operator": "===",
        "left": {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "span": {
            "start": 0,
            "end": 3,
            "ctxt": 0
          },
          "value": "foo",
          "optional": false
        },
        "right": {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "span": {
            "start": 8,
            "end": 11,
            "ctxt": 0
          },
          "value": "bar",
          "optional": false
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "interpreter": null
}
```

## Testing your transform

### logging

SWC uses `tracing` for logging.
