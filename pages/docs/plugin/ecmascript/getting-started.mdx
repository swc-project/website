# Implementing a plugin

## Setup environment

### Install required toolchain

As plugin is written in the rust programming language and built as a `.wasm` file, you need to install rust toolchain and wasm target.

#### Install rust

You can follow instructions at ['Install Rust' page from the official rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

#### Add wasm target to rust

SWC supports two kinds of `.wasm` files.
Those are

- wasm32-wasi
- wasm32-unknown-unknown

In this guide, we will use `wasm-wasi` as a target.

#### Install `swc_cli`

You can install a rust-based CLI for SWC by doing

```sh
cargo install swc_cli
```

#### Configuring IDE

If you are going to use vscode, it's recommended to install `rust-analyzer` extension.
`rust-analyzer` is a [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for the rust programming language, which provides good features for code completion, code navigation, and code analysis.

## Implementing simple plugin

### Create a project

SWC CLI supports creating a new plugin project.

Run

```sh
swc plugin new --target-type wasm32-wasi my-first-plugin
# You should to run this
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

to create a new plugin, and open `my-first-plugin` with your preferred rust IDE.

### Implementing a visitor

The generated code has

```rust
impl VisitMut for TransformVisitor {
    // Implement necessary visit_mut_* methods for actual custom transform.
    // A comprehensive list of possible visitor methods can be found here:
    // https://rustdoc.swc.rs/swc_ecma_visit/trait.VisitMut.html
}
```

which is used to transform code.
[The trait `VisitMut`](https://rustdoc.swc.rs/swc_ecma_visit/trait.VisitMut.html) supports mutating AST nodes, and as it supports all AST types, it has lots of methods.

---

We will use

```js
foo === bar;
```

as the input. From [the SWC Playground](https://play.swc.rs), you can get actual representation of this code.

```json
{
  "type": "Module",
  "span": {
    "start": 0,
    "end": 12,
    "ctxt": 0
  },
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "ExpressionStatement",
      "span": {
        "start": 0,
        "end": 12,
        "ctxt": 0
      },
      "expression": {
        "type": "BinaryExpression",
        "span": {
          "start": 0,
          "end": 11,
          "ctxt": 0
        },
        "operator": "===",
        "left": {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "span": {
            "start": 0,
            "end": 3,
            "ctxt": 0
          },
          "value": "foo",
          "optional": false
        },
        "right": {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "span": {
            "start": 8,
            "end": 11,
            "ctxt": 0
          },
          "value": "bar",
          "optional": false
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "interpreter": null
}
```

Let's implement a method for `BinExpr`.
You can do it like

```rust
use swc_core::{
    ast::*,
    visit::{VisitMut, VisitMutWith},
};

impl VisitMut for TransformVisitor {
    fn visit_mut_bin_expr(&mut self, e: &mut BinExpr) {
        e.visit_mut_children_with(self);
    }
}
```

Note that `visit_mut_children_with` is required if you want to call the method handler for children.
e.g. `visit_mut_ident` for `foo` and `bar` will be called by `e.visit_mut_children_with(self);` above.

Let's narrow down it using the binary operator.

```rust
use swc_core::{
    ast::*,
    visit::{VisitMut, VisitMutWith},
    common::Spanned,
};

impl VisitMut for TransformVisitor {
    fn visit_mut_bin_expr(&mut self, e: &mut BinExpr) {
        e.visit_mut_children_with(self);

        if e.op == op!("===") {
            e.left = Box::new(Ident::new("kdy1".into(), e.left.span()).into());
        }
    }
}
```

`op!("===")` is a macro call, and it returns various types of operators.
It returns [BinaryOp](https://rustdoc.swc.rs/swc_ecma_ast/enum.BinaryOp.html) in this case, because we provided `"==="`, which is a binary operator.
See [the rustdoc for op! macro](https://rustdoc.swc.rs/swc_ecma_ast/macro.op.html) for more details.

If we run this plugin, we will get

```js
kdy1 === bar;
```

## Testing your transform

You can simply run `cargo test` to test your plugins.
SWC also provides a utility to ease fixture testing.

You can easily verify the input and output of the transform.

```rust
test!(
    Default::default(),
    |_| as_folder(TransformVisitor),
    boo,
    r#"foo === bar;"#,
    r#"kdy1 === bar;"#
);
```

You can take a look at [the real fixture test for typescript type stripper](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/blob/c0abdb394a94bcbc7ea9602163e6ce032c89b996/crates/swc_ecma_transforms_typescript/tests/strip.rs#L4514-L4527).

```rust
#[testing::fixture("tests/fixture/**/input.ts")]
#[testing::fixture("tests/fixture/**/input.tsx")]
fn fixture(input: PathBuf) {
    let output = input.with_file_name("output.js");
    test_fixture(
        Syntax::Typescript(TsConfig {
            tsx: input.to_string_lossy().ends_with(".tsx"),
            ..Default::default()
        }),
        &|t| chain!(tr(), properties(t, true)),
        &input,
        &output,
    );
}

```

Things to note:

- The glob provided to `testing::fixture` is relative to the cargo project directory.
- The output file is `output.js`, and it's stored in a same directory as the input file.
- `test_fixture` drives the test.
- You can determine the syntax of the input file by passing the syntax to `test_fixture`.
- You then provide your visitor implementation as the second argument to `test_fixture`.
- Then you provide the input file path and the output file path.

### Logging

SWC uses `tracing` for logging.
By default, SWC testing library configures the log level to `debug` by default, and this can be controlled by using an environment variable named `RUST_LOG`.
e.g. `RUST_LOG=trace cargo test` will print all logs, including `trace` logs.

If you want, you can remove logging for your plugin by using cargo features of `tracing`.
See [the documentation for it](https://docs.rs/crate/tracing/latest/features).
