# Implementing a plugin

## Setup environment

### Install required toolchain

As plugin is written in the rust programming language and built as a `.wasm` file, you need to install rust toolchain and wasm target.

#### Install rust

You can follow instructions at ['Install Rust' page from the official rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

#### Add wasm target to rust

SWC supports two kind of `.wasm` files.
Those are

- wasm32-wasi
- wasm32-unknown-unknown

#### Configuring IDE

If you are going to use vscode, it's recommended to install `rust-analyzer` extension.
`rust-analyzer` is a [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for the rust programming langauge, which provides good features for code completion, code navigation, and code analysis.
