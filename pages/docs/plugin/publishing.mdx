# Publishing plugins

If you prefer reading codes, you can refer to [the repository for official plugins](https://github.com/swc-project/plugins).

## Creating a npm package

### Building a plugin as a wasm

You can run your plugin as a wasm file by running

```sh
cargo build-wasi --release // build wasm32-wasi target binary
cargo build-wasm32 --release // build wasm32-unknown-unknown target binary
```

It will create `target/wasm32-wasi/release/your_plugin_name.wasm` or `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your_plugin_name.wasm`, depending on your config.

### Creating a npm package for plugin

Add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "main": "your_plugin_name.wasm",
    "scripts": {
        "prepack": "cargo prepublish --release && cp target/wasm32-wasi/release/your_plugin_name.wasm ."
    },
}
```

## Advanced: Improving your plugin

### Adjusting configuration for smaller binary

You can reduce the size of the plugin by configuring cargo.

In your `Cargo.toml` file, you can add the following lines.

```toml
[profile.release]
# This removes more dead code
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
# Optimize for size
opt-level = "s"
# Optimize for performance, this is default so you don't need to specify it
# opt-level = "z"

# Strip debug symbols
strip = "symbols"
```

### Removing log for release mode

If logging of your crate is too much, you can remove it by enabling `release_max_level_*` of `tracing`, like

```toml
tracing = { version="0.1", features = ["release_max_level_info"] }
```
