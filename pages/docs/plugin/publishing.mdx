# Publishing plugins

If you prefer reading codes, you can refer to [the repository for official plugins](https://github.com/swc-project/plugins).

## Adjusting configuration for smaller plugin

You can reduce the size of the plugin by configuring cargo.

In your `Cargo.toml` file, you can add the following lines.

```toml
[profile.release]
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
opt-level = "s"
```

## Creating a npm package for plugin

You can build the required wasm file by using `cargo build`.

```sh

cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi
# or if you want to use wasm32-unknown-unknown insteadf of wasm32-wasi
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

```
