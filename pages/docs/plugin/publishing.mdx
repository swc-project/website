# Publishing plugins

If you prefer reading codes, you can refer to [the repository for official plugins](https://github.com/swc-project/plugins).

## Creating a npm package

### Building a plugin as a wasm

You can run your plugin as a wasm file by running

```sh
cargo build-wasi --release // build wasm32-wasi target binary
cargo build-wasm32 --release // build wasm32-unknown-unknown target binary
```

It will create `target/wasm32-wasi/release/your_plugin_name.wasm` or `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your_plugin_name.wasm`, depending on your config.

### Creating a npm package for plugin

Add the following to your `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
    "main": "your_plugin_name.wasm",
    "scripts": {
        "prepack": "cargo prepublish --release && cp target/wasm32-wasi/release/your_plugin_name.wasm ."
    },
}
```

## Using the npm package

To use the plugin, add it to `devDependencies` (or whatever is the best place for it) in your `package.json`. Note that this is not in your plugin's `package.json`! It has to be added to whatever project is consuming the plugin npm package.

The same package name also needs to be added in the swc configuration. We'll assume that you used the name `swc_plugin` as the name of your npm package. Make sure your `.swcrc` has at least the following:

```jsonc filename=".swcrc" copy
{
  "jsc": {
    "experimental": {
      "plugins": [["swc_plugin", {}]]
    }
  }
}
```

Each plugin in the `jsc.experimental.plugins` array is also identified by an array. The first element is the name of the package containing the plugin. The second element is any configuration to be passed to the plugin.

## Advanced: Improving your plugin

### Adjusting configuration for smaller binary

You can reduce the size of the plugin by configuring cargo.

In your `Cargo.toml` file, you can add the following lines.

```toml filename="Cargo.toml"
[profile.release]
# This removes more dead code
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
# Optimize for size
opt-level = "s"
# Optimize for performance, this is default so you don't need to specify it
# opt-level = "z"

# Strip debug symbols
strip = "symbols"
```

### Removing log for release mode

If logging of your crate is too much, you can remove it by enabling `release_max_level_*` of `tracing`, like

```toml
tracing = { version="0.1", features = ["release_max_level_info"] }
```
