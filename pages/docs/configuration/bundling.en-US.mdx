# Bundling Configuration

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
  This feature is still under construction.
</Callout>

SWC is able to bundle multiple JavaScript or TypeScript files into one.

This feature is currently named `spack`, but will be renamed to `swcpack` in `v2`. `spack.config.js` will be deprecated for `swcpack.config.js`.

View a [basic example of bundling](https://github.com/swc-project/cli/tree/master/examples/spack-basic).

## Configuration

You can configure bundling using `spack.config.js` with similar options to webpack. In the future, we are exploring a webpack compatible plugin system.

```js
// spack.config.js

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    web: __dirname + "/src/index.ts",
  },
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/lib",
  },
};
```

> Note: CommonJS is currently required. In the future, ES Modules will be supported.

If you want auto-completion or type checking for configuration, you can wrap the export with a `config` function from `@swc/core/spack`. It's an identity function with type annotation.

```ts
const { config } = require("@swc/core/spack");

module.exports = config({
  entry: {
    web: __dirname + "/src/index.ts",
  },
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/lib",
  },
});
```

### mode

Possible values: `production`, `debug`, `none`.

Currently this value is not used, but it will behave similarly to webpack.

### entry

Determines the entry of bundling. You may specify a file or a map of bundle name to file path.

> Note: Currently this should be absolute path. You can use `__dirname` to create one.
>
> In the future, SWC will support using relative paths and will resolve files relative to `spack.config.js`.

### output

You can change destination directory of the bundler using `output`.

```ts
const { config } = require("@swc/core/spack");

module.exports = config({
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/lib",
    // Name is optional.
    name: "index.js",
  },
});
```

### options

Used to control the behavior of SWC. This field is optional.
