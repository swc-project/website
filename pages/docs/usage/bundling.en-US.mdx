# Bundling (swcpack)

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
  This feature is still under construction.
</Callout>

SWC is able to bundle multiple JavaScript or TypeScript files into one.

This feature is currently named `spack`, but will be renamed to `swcpack` in `v2`. `spack.config.js` will be deprecated for `swcpack.config.js`.

View a [basic example of bundling](https://github.com/swc-project/cli/tree/master/examples/spack-basic).

## Usage

```sh
npm i --save-dev @swc/cli @swc/core
```

Create a `spack.config.js` file and run:

```plaintext
npx spack
```

## Configuration

To see all options, [view the configuration](/docs/configuration/bundling).

## Features

### Compact Output

Just like `rollup`, SWC emits compact output.

`a.js`

```js
console.log("loading A");
export function a() {
  console.log("use!");
}
```

`lib.js`

```js
import { a } from "./a";
a();
```

becomes:

```js
console.log("loading A");
function a() {
  console.log("use!");
}
a();
```

SWC was designed with merging in mind, so naming collisions between multiple files are automatically handled.

### Tree Shaking

Just like other modern bundlers, SWC can remove unused exports.

### Import Deglobbing

To aid with tree-shaking, SWC deglobs imports if possible.

```js
import * as lib from "lib";
lib.foo();
```

behaves exactly same as:

```js
import { foo } from "lib";
foo();
```

This preserves all side effects.

### CommonJS Support

SWC supports importing CommonJS modules and emits more compact output than webpack.

```js
import * as lib from "lib";
console.log(lib); // Prevent dce
```

If the `lib` above is a CommonJS module, it's transcompiled to:

```js
const load = __spack_require.bind(void 0, function (module, exports) {
  // Code from lib goes here
});
const lib = load();
console.log(lib); // Prevent dce
```

### Optimizations

- Global Inlining (e.g. `process.env.NODE_ENV`)
- Inlining
- Constant propagation
- Dead code elimination

The tree shaking described above is using the dead code elimination pass. Currently, SWC can deduce:

```js
let b = 2;
let a = 1;
if (b) {
  a = 2;
}
let c;
if (a) {
  c = 3;
}
console.log(c);
```

into:

```js
console.log(3);
```

### High Performance

Performance is a priority for SWC. It's very fast because it uses all CPU cores and is optimized by `llvm`.

### Multiple Entries Support

`spack.config.js`:

```js
const { config } = require("@swc/core/spack");

module.exports = config({
  entry: {
    web: __dirname + "/src/web.ts",
    android: __dirname + "/src/android.ts",
  },
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/lib",
  },
  module: {},
});
```

### Built-in Chunking

Using the same config as above, if `android.ts` and `web.ts` both references the same file, it will be extracted as a separate chunk and `web.ts` and `android.ts` will import it.
