# Bundling (swcpack)

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
  This feature is still under construction.
</Callout>

SWC is able to bundle multiple JavaScript or TypeScript files into one.

This feature is currently named `spack`, but will be renamed to `swcpack` in `v2`. `spack.config.js` will be depreated for `swcpack.config.js`.

View a [basic example of bundling](https://github.com/swc-project/cli/tree/master/examples/spack-basic).

## Usage

```sh
npm i --save-dev @swc/cli @swc/core
```

Create a `spack.config.js` file and run:

```plaintext
npx spack
```

## Configuration

To see all options, [view the configuration](/docs/configuration/bundling).
