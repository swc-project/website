## Improvements

### `hygiene`: Less renaming of variables ([#1600](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1600))

`swc` uses special system for managing identifiers. The system modifies lots of identifiers, even when it's not required.
This is now fixed and swc renames only if required.

Implemented by [#2193](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2193).

## Bugfixes

### Variables in for-in loops ([#2164](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2164))

Previously, `swc` dropped some variables declared in for-in loops in async functions, when targeting `es5` or lower.

Fixed by [#2181](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2181).

### parser: arrow in cond ([#2174](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2174))

Previously, `swc` tried to parse the code below as function expression with a typescript type annotation.

```js
const x = {
  prop: isCorrect ? (fn) => ({}) : (fn) => true,
};
```

Fixed by [#2178](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2178).

### jsx: `<>` with single child ([#2177](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2177))

Previously `swc` did not produce optimal code for

```js
export var App = function () {
  return (
    <>
      <div>1</div>
    </>
  );
};
```

Fixed by [#2178](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2178).
