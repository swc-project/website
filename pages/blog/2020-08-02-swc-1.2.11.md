## Bugfixes

### super statements ([#918](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/918))

Thanks to [@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn), no statement will be injected before `super()`. The patch affects code like

```ts
export class BadRequestError extends Error {
  constructor(public readonly message: string) {
    super(message);
  }
}
```

by making the call to `_definedProperty` generated because of `public readonly message` to be injected after `super(message);`.

### [key: string]: Type is stripped out properly ([#922](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/922))

Previously, in the code below,

```ts
export abstract class Kernel {
  /**
   * Multiple variables that will be defined during runtime,
   * holding the values of the commands passed from the user
   */
  [key: string]: any;
}
```

`[key: string]: any;` was not stripped out properly. This is reported by the deno team, and the bug makes me look for a way to find typescript-related bugs, and as a result, `swc@v1.2.11` is full of typescript related patches. I used tests from the official typescript repository to ensure generated ecmascript files are valid.

### binding identifier named await ([#924](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/924))

I think this will not affect real-world codes, but it's fixed anyway.

```ts
function foo(await = await) {
  // ???
}
```

was incorrectly parsed as

```ts
function foo(this = await) {
  // ???
}
```

but it's now fixed.

### export declare class ([#924](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/924))

Because `declare` is typically used in .d.ts files, it will not affect many codes. Code like

```ts
export declare class Foo {}
```

should be compiled out, and it is, starting from `swc@v1.2.11`.

### declare var ([#924](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/924))

I expect this patch to affect some of codebases.

```ts
declare var a: string;
```

`a` in the code above is now removed completely.

### conditional enum declarations in if ([#924](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/924))

Just don't do this. Although `swc` handles it, it's not the right thing to do.

```ts
if (2) enum A {}
```

### sequence expression in key ([#924](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/924))

Again, don't do this. You can does not mean you should. Anyway, because `swc` tries to follow the spec as much as possible, I added some code to handle the code below.

```ts
class C extends Base {
  [(super(), "prop")]() {}
}
```

Note: The bug will not affect your code if you are targeting `es3` or `es5`.

### await in heritage clause ([#924](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/924))

Accoarding to the ecmascript spec, the code below is valid.

```ts
class A extends (await B) {}
```

Note: The bug will not affect your code if you are targeting `es3` or `es5`.

### optional array / object pattern ([#924](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/924))

`?` in the code below was problematic.

```ts
function foo([a, b, c]?) {}
```

```ts
function foo({ a, b, c }?) {}
```

They should both be compiled as

```ts
function foo([a, b, c]) {}
```

but they were compiled as

```ts
function foo([a, b, c]?) {}
```

```ts
function foo({ a, b, c }?) {}
```

respectively, and the typescript code handler is fixed. If you were using `es3` or `es5` as a target, the bug will not affect you.
