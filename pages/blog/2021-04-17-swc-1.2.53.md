## Bugfixes

### bundler: Complex reexports within cycles ([#1576](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1576))

Previously there was some edge cases which is not properly handled by the [swc][] bundler.
The bug ocurred only when it's reexported using `export *`, was in a cylcle of dependency and requires some more complex conditions.
It's is now fixed.

### regnerator: Fix for delegating yields ([#1580](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1580))

There was a bug related to delegating yields (`yield *`) and it affected codes like

```ts
function* a() {
  yield 5;
  return 7;
}
function* b() {
  let x = yield* a();
  yield x + 1;
}
expect([...b()]).toEqual([5, 8]);
```

It's fixed by [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett).

### Correct helper name ([#1578](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1578))

[swc][] used incorrect helper name in some cases. It's fixed by [@grimly](https://github.com/grimly)

### fixer: Fix for yields in ternaries ([#1577](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1577))

Previously [swc][] miscompiled `(yield foo) ? "bar" : "baz"` as `yield foo ? "bar" : "baz"`.

It's fixed by [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett).

### codegen: Fix for rest patterns ([#1573](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1573))

Affected code looks like

```ts
function myFunc({ ...data }: { field: string }) {}
```

### bundler: Various bugfixes ([#1572](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1572))

It includes bugfixes for complexly nested `export *`-s and the fix for a dead-code-elimination bug.

### Fix for scope of functions ([#1559](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1559))

[swc][] compiled

```js
var Test = (function () {
  var Test = (function () {
    var Test = 2;
    return Test;
  })();

  return Test;
})();
```

into

```js
var Test = (function () {
  var Test = (function () {
    var Test1 = 2;
    return Test; // <- this is wrong
  })();
  return Test;
})();
```

which is wrong, but the bug is now fixed and it emits

```js
var Test1 = (function () {
  var Test2 = (function () {
    var Test3 = 2;
    return Test3;
  })();

  return Test2;
})();
```

Fixed by [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett).

### Fix for unknown object property accesses ([#1567](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1567))

[swc][] now does not compile `{}.foo` as `undefined` anymore.
Previously [swc][] wrongly compiled it as such if optimizer is enabled.

Fixed by [@mischnic](https://github.com/mischnic).

### Fix for parens of sequence expressions in callee and params ([#1566](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1566))

Previsously [swc][] miscompiled

```js
let x = ({}, () => 2)();
```

as

```
let x = {
}, ()=>2
();
```

which is clearly wrong.

Fixed by [@devongovett](https://github.com/devongovett).

### this = globalThis in imported functions ([#1561](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1561))

```js
import foo from "foo";
foo.bar();
```

is now compiled with `module: commonjs` as

```js
const foo = require("foo"); // This is bit different.
(0, foo).bar();
```

to make `this` in `bar` point the module.

Fixed by [@Austaras](https://github.com/Austaras).

### Block scoping of class declarations ([#1569](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1569))

```js
const g = 20;

function baz() {
  {
    class g {}
  }

  return g;
}
```

is now

```js
const g = 20;
function baz() {
  {
    class g1 {}
    console.log(g1);
  }
  return g;
}
```

instead of previous

```js
const g1 = 20; // <- this is wrong
function baz() {
  {
    class g1 {}
  }
  return g; // <- this is wrong
}
```
