## Improvements

### Error for top-level await in sciprts

swc now emits a user-friendly error message for top level awaits in a script.

Implemented by [@sosukesuzuki](https://github.com/sosukesuzuki) and by [#2094](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2094)

### `minify.format.comments` ([#2095](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2095))

swc now supports `format.comments` of terser, which controls the comments.

Implemented by [#2095](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2095).

## Bugfixes

### codegen: `~` ([#2091](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2091))

Previously swc wrongly skipped a semicolon before `~` when minification is enabled.

Fixed by [#2104](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2104).
