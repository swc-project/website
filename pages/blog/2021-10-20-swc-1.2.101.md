## Improvements

### Performance of typescript parsing

There was some useless backtracking while parsing typescript.

Fixed by [#2483](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2483).

### `inline_globals`: typeof, member expression

You can now use `swc` to replace `typeof`s and complex expressions like `process.browser`.

Implemented by [#2479](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2479) and [#2473](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2473).

### Default value for source maps

`swc` now emits source map context by default, and you can disable it using `inlineSourcesContent: false`.

Fixed by [#2471](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2471).

## Bugfixes

### private static properties ([#2476](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2476))

Previously, `swc` could break code like

```js
class Foo {
  static #_ = (() => {
    this.bar = "3";
  })();
}
```

Fixed by [#2478](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2478).

### minifier

There was a bug in inlining pass of the minifier.

Fixed by [#2477](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2477)
