## Bugfixes

### Fix for `arguments` in for loops ([#1462](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1462))

Previously the helper of swc was broken by this bug.
It's now fixed and new version of `@swc/helpers` works properly.

### regnerator: var in proper level ([#1718](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1718))

Previously swc might break codes like

```ts
async function scanUser(groups: { users: number[] }[]) {
  await Promise.all(
    groups.map(async ({ users }) => {
      for (const user of users) {
        console.log("user", user);
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 30));
      }
    })
  );
}

scanUser([{ users: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] }, { users: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] }]);
```

because the variable for iterator are recycled while it should not.
It's now fixed by injecting variables at proper level.

### escapes in jsx attribute values ([#1661](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1661))

The afffected code looks like

```js
console.log(<h1 value="abc\nas">s</h1>);
```

### regenerator: `||` handled properly ([#1684](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1684))

Previously swc had a bug related to `await` in rhs of `||` and code like

```ts
const cache = {};

async function getThing(key) {
  const it = cache[key] || (await fetchThing(key));
  return it;
}

function fetchThing(key) {
  return Promise.resolve(key.toUpperCase()).then((val) => (cache[key] = val));
}
```

was miscompiled.

It's now fixed.

### bundler: Complex circular imports ([#1739](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1739))

In a very complex cirular import scenario, the bundler may hang because of infinite recursions.

It's now fixed.

### typscript: Arrow expr with class expr https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1738

The typescript type stripped of swc compiled arrow expressions with a class expression as a body wonrly.

The affected code looks like and it's now fixed.

```ts
const fn = () => class Bug {};
console.log(fn());
```

### codegen: Unicode characters ([#1744](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1744))

Previously swc could break codes for old targets like

```js
console.log("ðŸ¤­ Ã¼");
```

It's not fixed.

### `this` in tagged template literals ([#1742](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1742))

swc, just like babel, had a bug related to `this` in tagged template literals.
This bug could break code like

```ts
class Foo {
  #tag() {
    return this;
  }

  #tag2 = this.#tag;

  constructor() {
    const receiver = this.#tag`tagged template`;
    console.log(receiver === this);

    const receiver2 = this.#tag2`tagged template`;
    console.log(receiver2 === this);
  }
}
new Foo();
```

### parser: TS1031 https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1751

Previously swc wrongly emitted an error for

```ts
class Foo {
  declare a: string;
}
```

Fixed by [@Shinyaigeek](https://github.com/Shinyaigeek).

### API type definition [#1746](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1746)

The typescript type checker will not report error for `keepClassNames` anymore.

### bundler: Support for file names ending with period. ([#1748](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1748))

Previously the bundler failed to bundler `core-js@^2` because of a bug in the resolver.

Fixed by [@tmpfs](https://github.com/tmpfs).

### bundler: Updated list for core modules. ([#1749](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1749))

node.js added some core modules and using them with the bundler resulted in an error because it tried to resolve it in `node_modules`.

Fixed by [@tmpfs](https://github.com/tmpfs).

### codegen: Class with minify and higher target ([#1764](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1764))

Previously swc had a codegen bug related to a class with `es2016`+ target and minify enabled.

Fixed by [@Shinyaigeek](https://github.com/Shinyaigeek).

## New platform support

### FreeBSD ([#1758](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1758))

[@Brooooooklyn](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn), the author of [a wonderful rust library](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) for creating node modules, added supports for FreeBSD.
