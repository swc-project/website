## New features

### type annotation in catch binding ([#942](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/942))

TypeScript 4.0 supports using `unknown` as a type of catch parameter, like

```
try {
} catch (e: unknown) {
}
```

[swc][] now supports it.

### emitDecoratorMetadata for typescript decorators ([#939](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/939))

You can now use [nest][] with [swc]! You need to configure [swc] as shown in [the document](/docs/configuring-swc#jsctransformdecoratormetadata).

[swc]: https://github.com/swc-project/swc
[nest]: https://nestjs.com/
