## Bugfixes

### Comments ([#1165](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1165))

swc doesn't drop comments anymore.

### modules: Var names ([#1787](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1787))

Previously swc had a bug which can break code if file name meets some condition.

Fixed by [@cspotcode](https://github.com/cspotcode).

### typescript: Object pattern ([#1835](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1835))

```ts
import { A } from "./a";
import { B } from "./b";

const { A: AB } = B;

console.log(A, AB);
```

Previosuly swc dropped `A` because of bug in variable collector.

Fixed by [@Austaras](https://github.com/Austaras).

### Fix helper used by module pass ([#1829](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1829))

Previously swc sometimes used wrong helper for module imports.

Fixed by [@cspotcode](https://github.com/cspotcode).

## fixer: call in new [#1857](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1857)

```ts
new (foo())();
```

Previously swc incorrrectly striped `(foo())` as `foo()`.

Fixed by [@motiz88](https://github.com/motiz88).

### optimizer: nullish coalescing operator ([#1851](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1851))

```ts
x ?? (x = "abc");
```

Preivousy the optmizer of swc incorrectly optimized it as `x = "abc";`.
It's now fixed.

## Improvements

### Supports for path aliasing ([#702](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/702))

swc now supports `paths`, which uses identical syntax for `paths` in `tsconfig.json`.

### Better sourcemap ([](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1796), [](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1713), [](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1685))

Source map generated by swc is greayly improved.
