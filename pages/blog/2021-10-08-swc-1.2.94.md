## Improvements

### Improved performance

`swc` is now even faster than before.
It uses faster `Mutex` implementation for global locks, and does not do syscall if it's not required.
I also removed some useless memory operations like `memmove`.

Done by [#2329](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2329) and [#2356](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2356).

Additionally, some duplicated passes are removed by [#2347](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2347) and [#2367](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2367).

### bundler: Concurrent bundling

Although the bundler of `swc` is designed to be run in parallel, `concurrent` mode was not enabled because I was busy working on other bugs.

Implemented by [#2356](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2356).

### jsx: Allow directives in any statement

This is required to use `mdx-loader` with `swc`.

Implemented by [#2377](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2377).

## Bugfixes

### parser: Error for array patterns

Previously `swc` allowed

```ts
const [a b] = arr
```

but now it's an error.

Implemented by [@g-plane](https://github.com/g-plane) and by [#2365](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2365).

### parser: Error for array expressions

Previously `swc` allowed

```ts
const arr = [a b]
```

but now it's an error.

Implemented by [@g-plane](https://github.com/g-plane) and by [#2366](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2366).

### minifier: inlining of iife

Previously, `swc` replaces parameters of an IIFE if the corresponding argument is an identifier or a literal. But replacing identifier can cause problems, so `swc` now only replaces with literals.

Fixed by [#2355](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2355)

### minifier: inlining and shorthand

Previously, if the minifier of `swc` decides to inline something which is used only once in a shorthand, `swc` revmoed the node without modifying the usage part in a shorthand property.

### minifier: `new String`

`swc` had some assumptions about code, just like the old version of the google closure compiler. The assumption was that a property of string is never modified. But the rule does not fit real-world codes, and the assumption broke some code.

Fixed by [#2341](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2341)

### `dead_branch_remover` bug ([#2328](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2328))

Previously, `swc` could break code like

```js
switch (true) {
  case true:
    console.error("true (expected branch)");
    break;

  case false:
    console.error("false (dead branch)");
    break;

  default:
    console.error("default (dead branch)");
    break;
}
```

Fixed by [@mischnic](https://github.com/mischnic) and by [#2373](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2373)

### bundler: trivial bug

The code for handling configs had a trivial bug.

Fixed by [@amoshydra](https://github.com/amoshydra) and by [#2335](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2335).
