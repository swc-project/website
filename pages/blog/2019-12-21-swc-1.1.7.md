## Statement Expression type ([#512](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/512))

_NOTE:_ Although this is a technically breaking change, I decided not to bump major version as I don't think someone has created a plugin which depends on exact type of an expression statement.

`swc` now stores expression statements as a new type named ExpressionStatement. This change is made to provide exact span of an expression statement.

## Regex type ([#511](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/511))

_NOTE:_ Although this is a technically breaking change, I decided not to bump major version as I don't think someone has created a plugin which depends on exact type of a regexp literal.

Type of Regex.expression and Regex.flags is string, not StringLiteral. This matches regexp type from babel and typescript.

## Fixed parsing of const enum ([#516](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/516))

`swc` previously parsed const enum correctly on debug mode, but it has a bug in release mode. This is fixed and (currently) a const enum works as a normal enum.

## Fixed space bug of the jsx trnasform ([#519](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/519))

```js
<div>Hello World</div>
```

is compiled as

```js
React.createElement("div", null, "Hello World");
```

instead of

```js
React.createElement("div", null, "Hello World ");
```
