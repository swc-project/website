## Improvements

### Automatic typescript detection ([#655](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/655))

As typescript support is embedded in `swc` by default, `swc` handles it out of the box.

You don't need any configuration to use typescript. Also note that It also detects `tsx` and automatically enables `tsx` for the files whose name ends with `.tsx`.

## Bugfixes

### TypeScript const assertion ([#656](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/656))

```ts
export const x = { text: "hello" } as const;
```

is transcompiled as

```ts
export const x = { text: "hello" };
```

### cli bugfixes ([#658](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/658))

Exclude fields in `.swcrc` now works correctly.

```json
{
  "test": ".*.tsx$",
  "exclude": ".*.spec.tsx$",
  "jsc": {
    "target": "es2018",
    "parser": {
      "syntax": "typescript",
      "tsx": true
    }
  }
}
```
