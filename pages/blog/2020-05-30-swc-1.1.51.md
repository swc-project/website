## Integration tests

`swc` now compiles and run the test suite of three.js and redux as a part of ci process. I tried to add more stuffs, but the build system of other projects were too complex to make it use swc.

## Bugfixes

### new expression

As part of integration test, I found that swc miscompiles

```js
new (a ? b : c)();
```

into

```js
new a() ? b : c();
```

This is fixed by the pr which introduced integration tests.

### Keywords in method name ([#801](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/801))

Previously, `swc` compiles

```ts
export class Foo {
  delete(object: string, key: string) {
    delete object[key];
  }
}
```

as

```js
var Foo = function() {
    'use strict';
    function Foo() {
        _classCallCheck(this, Foo);
    }
    _createClass(Foo, [
        {
            key: 'delete',
            value: function delete(object, key) {
                delete object[key];
            }
        }
    ]);
    return Foo;
}();
exports.Foo = Foo;
```

, which is wrong as function name cannot be `delete`. `swc` now compiles it as `function _delete`.
