## Improvements

### `this` in arrow expressions ([#2212](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2212))

`swc` now emits similar output to babel instead of using `bind`.

Implemented by [#2222](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2222).

## Bugfixes

### unary with exponential operation ([#2191](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2191))

`swc` now wraps an unary expression before an exponentation operator.

Fixed by [#2222](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2222).

### parser: Ternary ([#2196](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2196))

`swc` can now parse

```ts
export const reproValue = true
  ? {}
  : {
      reproFunc: (_: any): any => {},
    };
```

correctly.

Fixed by [#2222](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2222).

### stack overflow ([#2223](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2223))

Previously `swc` throwed an error if a `Program` is too large.

Fixed by [#2222](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2222).

### `jsc.paths` ([#2050](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2050))

Finally `swc` correctly implements support for `paths` and `baseUrl`.

Fixed by [#2227](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2227).
