## Bugfixes

### super in decorated methods ([#846](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/846))

Previously swc emitted wrong code if a method call from super is used.

```ts
class SomeClass {
  @dec
  someMethod() {}
}

class OtherClass extends SomeClass {
  @dec
  anotherMethod() {
    super.someMethod();
  }
}
```

Codes like above now works properly.

## dce: Fix for decorated classes ([#1769](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1769))

```ts
@decorator
class Class {}

function decorator(cls: any) {
  console.log(cls.name);
}
```

Previously swc dropped a class if it's decorated and not instantiated. This is wrong because decorators can have side effects and now it's fixed.

### bundler: Prevent hang ([#1779](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1779))

In certain complex import scenarios, the bundler of swc hanged while determinging cycle imports. This is now fixed and fairly complex imports are now handled by the bundler.

### fixer: Binary expressions in unary operands ([#1781](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1781), [#1789](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1789))

There was a regression related to parenthesis.

```ts
const n = ~~(Math.PI * 10);
```

```ts
const c = +(+1 / 4);
console.log(c);
```

These was miscompiled but it's now fixed.

### Support for `export *` with same name ([#1780](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1780))

swc now supports code like

```ts
// constant.ts
export enum Foo {}
```

```ts
// File1.ts
export { Foo } from "./constant";
```

```ts
// file2.ts
export { Foo } from "./constant";
```

### Fix for double imports ([#1757](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1757))

Previously swc throwed an error for double imports like

```ts
import "testlibrary";
import { aFunc } from "testlibrary";

console.log("aFunc: ", aFunc(1, 2));
```

It's now fixed.

### Fix for async generator ([#1752](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1752))

Previously swc miscompiled `await` in async generators and codes like

```ts
async function* generate(): AsyncGenerator {
  const results = await Promise.all([
    Promise.resolve(1),
    Promise.resolve(2),
    Promise.resolve(3),
  ]);
  for (const result of results) {
    console.log(`yield ${result}`);
    yield result;
  }
}

async function printValues() {
  const iterator = generate();
  for await (const value of iterator) {
    console.log(`iterator value: ${value}`);
  }
}

printValues();
```

was broken. It's now fixed.
