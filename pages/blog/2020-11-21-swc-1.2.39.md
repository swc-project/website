## Bugfixes

### Preserved input ([#1221](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1221))

[swc][] now respects the input, and preserves escapes.

### Private name in interfaces ([#1211](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1211))

[swc][] previously aborted on input like the below. This is changed to normal error.

```ts
interface Foo {
  #bar();
}
```

### Bundler rework ([#1212](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1212))

`spack`, the bundler of [swc] project, got a large refactoring and it can now handle almost all valid es codes. As the bundler is also used by [deno][], the pr contains lots of test for [deno][].

## New features

### BigInt literals as property keys ([#1192](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/1192))

Thanks to [@braddunbar](https://github.com/braddunbar), [swc][] now supports using bigint literal as a key of property.
