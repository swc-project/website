## Improvements

### Performance

The performance of code generator and the parser is improved by [#2406](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2406), and performance of transforms are improved by [#2438](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2439).

### New option

You can now specify `module.ignoreDynamic` to keep dynamic imports, while targeting other module systems.

Implemented by [#2441](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2441).

## Bugfixes

### minifier: Side effect

Preivously the minifier skipped an arugment of a call expression instead of aborting inlining, if it should not be inlined because of side effects.

Fixed by [#2433](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2433).

### decorator metadata ([#2428](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2428))

Previously `swc` failed to detect type of a parameter if there was a default value.

```
async fnName(
    ...
    @Arg('GraphQLArgName', {nullable: true}) argName: boolean = false,
): Promise<number> {
```

Fixed by [#2431](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2431).
