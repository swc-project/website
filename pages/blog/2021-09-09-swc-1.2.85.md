## Improvements

### minifier ([#21083](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2183))

Lots of rules are implemeneted.

## Bugfixes

### minifier: Empty return ([#2214](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2214))

Previously swc broke code like

```js
function f(a, b) {
  if (a) {
    if (b) return;
    foo();
  }
  bar();
}
```

Fixed by [#2183](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2183).

### codegen: unary minus ([#2213](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2213))

Preivsouly swc broke code like

```js
function f(a, b, c) {
  return a - -b * c;
}
```

if minification is enabled.

Fixed by [#2183](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2183).

### typescript: re-export of type ([#2219](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2219))

Previsouly swc didn't remove `export { TestInfo }` in the code below.

```ts
import type { TestInfo } from "./config";

export { TestInfo };
```

Fixed by [#2220](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/2220).
