## Bugfixes

### optional constructor property parameters ([#959](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/959))

Previously `test?` in the code below was miscompiled. It's now fixed and `swc` generates correct output.

```ts
export class Test {
  constructor(readonly test?: string) {}
}
```

### Some dce bugs ([#959](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/959))

While abstraction of the spack, I added much more test cases and fixed some tree-shaking bugs.

## Improvements

### cyclic dependencies ([#959](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/pull/959))

`spack` now supprots cyclic dependencies between es modules.
