# SWC Website

### TODO

- Add GA `UA-81467907-3` back
- Add OpenCollective
- GH publish to GH pages - we can remove this right?
- Do we want algolia or Stork?
- Delete docs folder
- Docs are redirected, but blog needs to be

```json
algolia: {
    apiKey: "5b6acdf7dc8baaa86317236bb5e2bb9e",
    indexName: "swc-project",
    algoliaOptions: {},
}
```

- Figure out what we want to do about the blog - should we keep every changelog? Or just link out to GitHub
